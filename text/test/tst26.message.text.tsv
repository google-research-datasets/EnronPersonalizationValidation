63	Mary, If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.
63	I can spread it over 6 or 12 months.
63	6 month payout would be $190/month.
63	12 month payout would be $95/month.
63	Your choice.
63	I would like it if you could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.
63	Does $10/hr sound fair?
63	We can apply it to the loan.
63	Phillip
64	I was glad to hear from you.
64	I hope we can put the past behind us.
64	Sounds like you have been busy.

64	Three is it for us.
64	What's your target?
64	The other two are doing well.
64	Soccer, T-ball, and bike riding keeps them busy.
64	They could use some of Cole's coordination.
64	My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.
64	I am just on maintenance.
64	You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical cyclist.
64	We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.
64	He never misses, rain or shine.
64	Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial Park on Saturdays.
64	Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the road.
64	I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.
64	I would like to hear more about your new job.
64	Maybe we could grab lunch sometime.
64	Phillip
65	Jeff, I will respond to the offer on Monday.
65	There is a $35 Million expansion adding 250 jobs in Burnet.
65	I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre.
65	Owner financing would still work.
65	Do you have an opinion?
65	Phillip
66	Lucy, Click on this attachment to see the format to record expenses.
66	You can keep a log on paper or on the computer.
66	The computer would be better for sending me updates.
66	What do you think about being open until noon on Saturday.
66	This might be more convenient for collecting rent and showing open apartments.
66	We can adjust office hours on another day.

70	Lucy, I want to speak to Wade myself.
70	He can call me at work or home.
70	Or if you email me his number I will call him.
70	I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him work orders for normal maintenance.
70	I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.
70	Do you need Mary to come in on any more Fridays?
70	I think I can guess your answer.
70	I might stop by this Friday.
70	Phillip
71	Scott, I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.
71	I think I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from him.
71	Basically, they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider.
71	Then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.
71	The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk.
71	This is my best guess.
71	I will get back to you with more.
71	Phillip
72	no
73	is your voice healed or are you going to use a real time messenger?

76	What are my choices for dates?
77	Tim, Matt sent you a email with his attempt to organize some of the cems and wscc data.

94	Wade, I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle situation.
94	You need to take care of it this week.
94	Lucy can't hold the tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) if the staff doesn't live up to it.

103	Please help Phillip
104	Lucy, Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.
104	First, I want to implement the following changes: 1.
104	No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
104	2.
104	Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily 3.
104	Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank 4.
104	No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic operations.
104	Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all the checks since Jan. 1.

104	I have questions about these items.
104	Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

110	What do I need to enter?
110	Phillip
111	Cooper, This is the website I use: Should I use a different address.
112	I tried the new address but I don't have access.
112	also, what do I need to enter under domain?
113	I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind of exclusive with Paine Weber.
113	I am starting to exercise now, but I am going to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex.
113	What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?
113	Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.
113	Thanks, Phillip
114	Mac, Thanks for the research report on EOG.
114	Here are my observations: Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.
114	Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices: That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.
114	I think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.
114	Current price 37 Nat.
114	Gas 34 Crude 10 Total 81 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?
114	To me this looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, Thank you, Phillip
115	Please cc the following distribution list with updates: Phillip Allen (pallen@enron.com) Keith Holst (kholst@enron.com) Monique Sanchez Frank Ermis John Lavorato Thank you for your help Phillip Allen
116	Open the "utility" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1).
116	You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.
116	If we have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.
116	Use the rates described in the spreadsheet.
116	This is a great chance for you to practice excel.
117	Lucy, Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week.
117	Then email the file back.
118	Lucy, We can discuss your email later.
118	How is progress on creating the spreadsheets.
118	You will probably need to close the file before you attach to an email.
118	It is 2:00.
118	I really want to make some progress on these two files.
118	Phillip
119	raincheck?
120	you have my approval
121	Lucy, I got your email with the attachment.
121	Let's work together today to get this done Phillip
122	Lucy, The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.
122	See if you can add these modifications: 1.
122	Use a formula in column E. Add the value in column C to column D. It should read =c6+d6.
122	Then copy this formula to the rows below.
122	2.
122	Column H needs a formula.
122	Subtract amount paid from amount owed.
122	3.
122	Column F is filled with the #### sign.
122	this is because the column width is too narrow.
122	Use you mouse to click on the line beside the letter F. Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.
122	4.
122	After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.
122	Phillip
123	Bruce, Can you stop by and set up my reuters.
123	Phillip
124	Brad, With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an associate.
124	Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a commercial manager.
124	I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end.
124	Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.
124	Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.
124	Let me know if there are any issues.
124	Phillip
125	Colleen, Please add Mike Grigsby to the distribution.
125	On another note, do you have any idea how Patti is holding up?
125	Phillip
126	Suzanne, Can you give me more details or email the plan prior to meeting?
126	What do I need to provide besides headcount?
126	Otherwise any afternoon next week would be fine Phillip
127	Mark, Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal basis and socal/san juan spreads.
127	I listed the days during bidweek that reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints before and after bidweek.

127	The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs actual of .79 2.
127	Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91 3.
127	Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

127	The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs actual of .99 2.
127	Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49 3.
127	Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the monthly postings 4.
127	Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

135	Let's shoot for Tuesday at 11:45.
136	Cooper, Can you give access to the new west power site to Jay Reitmeyer.
136	He is an analyst in our group.
136	Phillip
137	Richard, Compare your california production to the numbers in the 2000 California Gas Report.
137	It shows 410.
137	But again that might be just what the two utilities receive.
138	resumes of whom?
139	Ina, Can you pull Tori K.'s and Martin Cuilla's resumes and past performance reviews from H.R.
140	Ina, I scheduled a meeting with Jean Mrha tomorrow at 3:30
141	Larry, Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development opportunities.
141	I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street.
141	that were built by Reagan Lehmann.
141	22 Units were sold for around $2 million.
141	($182,000/duplex).
141	I spoke to Reagan and he indicated that he had more units under construction that would be available in the 180's.
141	Are the units he is selling significantly different from yours?
141	He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor plan.
141	My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.
141	As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.
141	Call or email with your thoughts.
141	Phillip
142	Jeff, You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood.
142	I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which I might become involved with Creekside.
142	Are you in the business of brokering properties or contacts?
142	Is your position based on a legal or what you perceive to be an ethical issue?
142	Did you propose we look at developing a project from scratch?
142	I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.
142	Phillip
143	why is aeco basis so low on the list?
143	Is NWPL mapped differently than AECO?
143	What about the correlation to Nymex on AECO?
144	The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.
144	This added 800 shorts to San Juan and 200 longs to Socal.
144	Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and
145	Jeff, I received the rent roll.
145	I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I am booked with stage coach.
145	I will drive by Friday evening.
145	I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.
145	Can you find out when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?
145	What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.
145	Remember we have to get Brenda happy.
145	Phillip
146	Lucy, You wrote fewer checks this month.
146	Spent more money on Materials and less on Labor.
146	June July August Here are my questions on the August bank statement (attached): 1.
146	Check 1406 Walmart Description and unit?
146	2.
146	Check 1410 Crumps Detail description and unit?
146	3.
146	Check 1411 Lucy What is this?
146	4.
146	Check 1415 Papes Detail description and units?
146	5.
146	Checks 1416, 1417, and 1425 Why overtime?
146	6.
146	Check 1428 Ralph's What unit?
146	7.
146	Check 1438 Walmart?
146	Description and unit?
146	Try and pull together the support for these items and get back to me.
146	Phillip
147	Brenda, I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on August 28th.
147	I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd.
147	#29, College Station, TX 77845.
147	I will go ahead and mail you another check.
147	If the first one shows up you can treat the 2nd as payment for October.
147	I know your concerns about the site plan.
147	I will not proceed without getting the details and getting your approval.
147	I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.
147	Phillip
148	Lucy, I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible.
148	I faxed you a copy of this file.
148	You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct amounts and I will input.
149	Jeff, I need to see the site plan for Burnet.
149	Remember I must get written approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.
149	I would also like to review the closing statements as soon as possible.
149	Phillip
150	Jeff, What is up with Burnet?
150	Phillip
151	George, Here sales numbers from Reagan: As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.
151	The 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling.
151	At 2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units under construction.
151	I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way.
151	The price I am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date.
151	Let me know what you think.
151	I will follow up with an email and phone call about Cherry Creek.
151	I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was rejected on the De Ville property.
151	Phillip Allen
152	George, Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate project: Ownership Structure What will be the ownership structure?
152	Limited partnership?
152	General partner?
152	What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and liabilities)?
152	Who owns the land?
152	improvements?
152	Who holds the various loans?
152	Is the land collateral?
152	Investment What happens to initial investment?
152	Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
152	Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?
152	When is the 700,000 actually needed?
152	Now or for the land closing?
152	Investment schedule?
152	Investment Return Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?
152	Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed?
152	Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan?
152	Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans?
152	Looks like it from the cash flow statement.
152	Terms of each loan?
152	Uses of Funds How will disbursements be made?
152	By whom?
152	What type of bank account?
152	Controls on max disbursement?
152	Internet viewing for investors?
152	Reports to track expenses vs plan?
152	Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?
152	What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?
152	Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits?
152	Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits?
152	Design and Construction When will design be complete?
152	What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?
152	What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting?
152	Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals?
152	Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?
152	Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use?
152	Names?
152	These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me.
152	Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process.
152	Phillip
153	John, Denver's short rockies position beyond 2002 is created by their Trailblazer transport.
153	They are unhedged 15,000/d in 2003 and 25,000/d in 2004 and They are scrubbing all their books and booking the Hubert deal on Wednesday and Thursday.

154	Kathy, Regarding the guest password for gas daily, can you please relay the information to Mike Grigsby at 37031 so he can pass it along to the user at gas daily today.
154	I will be out of the office on Friday.
154	thank you Phillip
155	Greg, Happy B-day.
155	Email me your phone # and I will call you.
155	Keith
156	Chris, What is the latest with PG&E?
156	We have been having good discussions regarding EOL.
156	Call me when you can.
156	X37041 Phillip
157	Nymex expiration is during this time frame.
157	Please reschedule.
158	Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index.
158	A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.
158	At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.
158	Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.
158	We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.
158	These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).
158	Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.
158	We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.
158	The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.
158	The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.
158	2.
158	The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily.
158	It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different.
158	I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.
158	Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.
158	I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.
158	It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index.
158	It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.
158	Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.
158	Sincerely, Phillip Allen
159	Brenda, Please use the second check as my October payment.
159	I have my copy of the original deal.
159	Do you want me to fax this to you?
159	Phillip
160	I think Fletch has a good CPA.
160	I am still doing my own.
161	Brenda, Please use the second check as the October payment.
161	If you have already tossed it, let me know so I can mail you another.

168	Bob, Any time tomorrow between 10 am and 1 pm would be good for looking at the plans.
168	As far as the TV's, what do you need me to do?
168	Do we need plasma screens or would regular monitors be just as good at a fraction of the cost.
168	Phillip
169	Lucy, Here are the actual utility bills versus the cap.
169	Did we collect these overages?
169	Let's discuss further?
169	Remember these bills were paid in July and August.

173	Bob, Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.
173	Patti stepped up to fill the gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.
173	Patti held together the scheduling group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.
173	Patti was always the first one in the office during this time.
173	Frequently, she would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.
173	All the traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.
173	This information has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size of the west desk positions.
173	Please call to discuss cash award.
173	Phillip
174	Andy, I spoke to John L. and he ok'd one of each new electronic system for the west desk.
174	Are there any operational besides ICE and Dynegy?
174	If not, can you have your assistant call me with id's and passwords.
174	Thank you, Phillip
175	Andy, Please assign a user name to Randy Gay.
175	Thank you, Phillip
176	Bob, Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy Gay was on a personal leave.
176	She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment to the west desk during that time.
176	She frequently came to work before 4 AM to prepare operations reports.
176	Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.
176	If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.
176	She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.
176	Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr.
176	specialist.
176	Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.
176	Let me know what is an acceptable cash amount.
176	Phillip
177	George, The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.
177	I have one other investor in addition to Keith that has interest.
177	Some additional background information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.
177	Background Questions: Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in Creekside.
177	Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.
177	Include the project description, investors, business entity, Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.
177	Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects.
177	With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the investors.
177	Preferable Investment Structure: Developers guarantee note, not investors.
177	Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.
177	Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.
177	Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now.
177	These questions are not intended to be offensive in any way.
177	It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that leads to future opportunities.
177	I am happy to provide you with any information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.
177	Sincerely, Phillip Allen
178	Dexter, I spoke to our EOL support group and requested a guest id for you.

178	Phillip
179	We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 to a 41.67 heat rate.
179	We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.
179	I guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year.
179	Prices seem low.
179	Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on Nov 99 loads and current gas prices.
179	What about a forecast for this November loads.
179	Let me know what you think.
179	Phillip
180	Bob, I spoke to Jeff.
180	He said he would not pay anything.

182	Dave, The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped from the Office of the Chairman.
182	Is your understanding that the West desk will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.
182	The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as follows: This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by the Denver desk.
182	The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.
182	Let me know if you disagree.
182	Phillip
183	Bob, Activate Plan B. No money from John.

195	The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.
195	It seems like most people are paying on time.
195	Did you rent an efficiency to the elderly woman on a fixed income?
195	Go ahead a use your judgement on the rent prices for the vacant units.
195	If you need to lower the rent by $10 or $20 to get things full, go ahead.

198	I would support Matt Lenhart's promotion to the next level.
198	I would oppose Ken Shulklapper's promotion.
199	Lucy, Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.
199	My only questions are: 1.
199	Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 12/01.
199	Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the beginning of the two week period.
199	What is going on?
199	2.
199	Gilbert in #27-is he just late?
199	Here is a file for 12/08.

210	George & Larry, If possible, I would like to get together in Columbus as Larry suggested.
210	Thursday afternoon is the only day that really works for me.
210	Let me know if that would work for you.
210	I was thinking around 2 or 2:30 pm.
210	I will try to email you any questions I have from the latest proforma tomorrow.
210	Phillip
211	Fax number 713-646-2391
212	Received the fax.
212	Thank you.
212	I might have to sell the QQQ and take the loss for taxes.
212	But I would roll right into a basket of individual technology stocks.
212	I think I mentioned this to you previously that I have decided to use this account for the kids college.
213	Please assign global id's to the four junior traders listed on Dawn's original email.
213	The are all trading and need to have unique id's.
213	Thank you
214	John, Here is our North of Stanfield forecast for Jan. Supply Jan '01 Dec '00 Jan '00 Demand Roosevelt capacity is 495.
214	Let me know how your forecast differs.
214	Phillip
215	Monique Sanchez Jay Reitmeyer Randy Gay Matt Lenhart
216	Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.
216	If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.
216	As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1.
216	Examine LDC's incentive rate program.
216	Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost.
216	The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
216	This creates a shortage in later months.
216	2.
216	California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand.
216	Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.
216	Specific questions should include: 1.
216	Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage?
216	2.
216	Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system.
216	I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand.
216	They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less.
216	3.
216	Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices.
216	Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs.
216	By design the customers are short at a floating rate.
216	This market has been long historically.
216	It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted.
216	Call me if you need any more input.
216	Phillip
217	Jeff, Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.
217	I have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow.
217	When will more money be required?
217	Escrow for roads?
217	Utility connections?
217	Other rezoning costs?
217	What about property taxes?
217	The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I owned it.
217	Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property?
217	Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned?
217	Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights?
217	What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing?
217	I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and American Multifamily walking on this deal.
217	So I just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can.
217	Phillip
218	Jim, I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I described to you last week.
218	The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos.
218	There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved.
218	As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee.
218	If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.
218	One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a "forward commitment" in order to reduce the equity required.
218	I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed.
218	Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing.
218	I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks.
218	I am faxing you a project summary.
218	And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you.
218	Let me know what else you need.
218	The land is scheduled to close mid January.
218	Phillip Allen
219	Gentlemen, I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.
219	Regarding the financing, I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.
219	I have sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information on you.
219	Can you please send it to him.
219	His contact information is: phone (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.
219	I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.
219	I hope to pull that together this afternoon.
219	I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.
219	He was positive about his experience overall.
219	He did not seem pleased with the bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.
219	I think we should discuss these procedures in advance.
219	Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.
219	Phillip
220	Trading Profits Rest of Desk 282 Total 945 I view my bonus as partly attributable to my own trading and partly to the group's performance.
220	Here are my thoughts.
220	Minimum Market Maximum Here are Mike's numbers.
220	I have not made any adjustments to them.
220	Minimum Market Maximum I have given him an "expectations" speech, but you might do the same at some point.
220	Phillip
221	I can't open a winmail.dat file.
221	can you send in a different format
222	cannot open this file.
222	Please send in different format
223	Questions about 12/29 rentroll: There were two deposits that were not labeled.
223	One for $150 and the other for $75.
223	Which apartments?
223	20a or #13?
223	Utility overages for #26 and #44?
223	Where did you get these amounts?
223	For what periods?
223	What is going on with #42.
223	Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!
223	That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling.
223	I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes.
223	If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor.
223	Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.
223	This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.
223	I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.
223	Is this right?
223	Has the deposit been made yet?
223	A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.
223	Phillip
224	Frank, Did you receive the information about the San Marcos apartments.
224	I have left several messages at your office to follow up.
224	You mentioned that your plate was fairly full.
224	Are you too busy to look at this project?
224	As I mentioned I would be interested in speaking to you as an advisor or at least a sounding board for the key issues.
224	Please email or call.
224	Phillip Allen
225	Ted, Andrea in the analysts pool asked me to fill out this request.
225	Can you help expedite this process?
225	Phillip
226	We do not understand our VAR.
226	Can you please get us all the detailed reports and component VAR reports that you can produce?
226	The sooner the better.
226	Phillip
227	Lucy, Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.
227	There are alot of overages.
227	It will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather.
227	You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.
227	This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.
227	I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.
227	We also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.
227	I will write something today.
227	Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start collecting.
227	Phillip
228	George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit.
228	Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.
228	At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.
228	Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.
228	However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.
228	Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1.
228	Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.
228	Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.
228	2.
228	+5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.
228	I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon.
228	Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 Phillip
229	Thanks for representing Matt.
229	Phillip
230	Larry, Do you want the loan and wire amount to be for exactly $1.1 million.
230	Phillip
231	Lucy, The apartments that have new tenants since December 15th are: Are we running an apartment complex or a motel?
231	Please update all lease information on the 1/12 rentroll and email it to me this afternoon.
231	Phillip
232	Jim, Here are the key gas contacts.

233	Andrea, Please resend the first three resumes.
233	Phillip
234	Kristin, Thank you for the California update.
234	Please continue to include me in all further intellegence reports regarding the situation in California.
234	Phillip
235	Lucy, Why did so many tenants not pay this week?
235	Total 975 It seems these apartments just missed rent.
235	What is up?
235	Other questions: #9-Why didn't they pay anything?
235	By my records, they still owe $40 plus rent should have been due on 12/12 of $220.
235	#3-Why did they short pay?
236	Larry, The wire should go out today.
236	I am in Portland but can be reached by cell phone 713-410-4679.
236	Call me if there are any issues.
236	I will place a call to my attorney to check on the loan agreement.
236	Phillip
237	Jeff, Here is a recent rentroll.
237	I understand another looker went to the property.
237	I want to hear the feedback no matter how discouraging.
237	I am in Portland for the rest of the week.
237	You can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679.
237	My understanding was that you would be overnighting some closing statements for Leander on Friday.
237	Please send them to my house (8855 Merlin Ct, Houston, TX 77055).
237	Call me if necessary.
237	Phillip
238	need help.
239	message board
240	Larry, I met with a banker that is interested in financing the project.
240	They need the following: Financial statements plus last two years tax returns.
240	Builders resume listing similar projects The banker indicated he could pull together a proposal by Friday.
240	If we are interested in his loan, he would want to come see the site.
240	If you want to overnight me the documents, I will pass them along.
240	You can send them to my home or office (1400 Smith, EB3210B, Houston, TX 77002).
240	The broker is Jim Murnan.
240	His number is 713-781-5810, if you want to call him and send the documents to him directly.
240	It sounds like the attorneys are drafting the framework of the partnership agreement.
240	I would like to nail down the outstanding business points as soon as possible.
240	Please email or call with an update.
240	Phillip
241	Lucy, Here is a rentroll for this week.
241	I still have questions on #28,#29, and #32.
242	Lucy, #32 and #29 are fine.
242	#28 paid weekly on 1/5.
242	Then he switched to biweekly.
242	He should have paid 260 on 1/12.
242	Two weeks rent in advance.
242	Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.
242	He either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the middle of his two weeks.
242	He is only paid one week in advance.
242	This is not a big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.
242	Here is an updated rentroll.
242	Please use this one instead of the one I sent you this morning.
242	Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.
242	Phillip
243	Nick, There is a specific program that we are using to recruit, train, and mentor new traders on the gas and power desks.
243	The trading track program is being coordinated by Ted Bland.
243	I have forwarded him your resume.
243	Give him a call and he will fill you in on the details of the program.
243	Phillip
244	Patti, This sounds like an opportunity to land a couple of analyst to fill the gaps in scheduling.
244	Remember their rotations last for one year.
244	Do you want to be an interviewer?
244	Phillip
245	Griff, Can you accomodate Dexter as we have in the past.
245	This has been very helpful in establishing a fair index at Socal Border.
245	Phillip Please cc me on the email with a guest password.
245	The sooner the better as bidweek is underway.
246	Dexter, You should receive a guest id shortly.
246	Phillip
247	George, We should hear from the bank in Houston on Monday.

248	Jeff, That is good news about Leander.
248	Now for the stage.
248	I would like to get it sold by the end of March.
248	I have about $225K invested in the stagecoach, it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.
248	I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee and Jaques Craig can work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a second lien.
248	I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
248	Checkout this spreadsheet.
248	These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.
248	However, I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.
248	Having Lucy show it is not a good idea.
248	I need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property.
248	My dad doesn't have the time and I don't trust Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.
248	I would prefer for you to show it from now on.
248	I will have the operating statements complete through December by this Friday.
248	Phillip
249	George, Keith and I are reviewing your proposal.
249	We will send you a response by this evening.
249	Phillip
250	Lucy, What is the latest?
250	Write me a note about what is going on and what issues you need my help to deal with when you send the rentroll.
250	Phillip
251	Jeff, Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.
251	1.
251	Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs.
251	Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs.
251	There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs.
251	2.
251	What is an outside management firm going to do?
251	A full time onsite manager is all that is required.
251	As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning.
251	Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care.
251	If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite.
251	3.
251	Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.
251	If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.
251	4.
251	Getting cash out is not a priority to me.
251	So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash.
251	A 10% note actually attractive.
251	See below.
251	My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.
251	This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.
251	Sales Price 705,000 Transfer fee 7,500 Cash required 14,500 Cash flow 29,014 Cash on cash 200% These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%.
251	This doesn't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price.
251	Do you want to reconsider?
251	Let me know.
251	Phillip
252	Testing.
252	Sell low and buy high
253	Nice.
253	how much?
253	Are you trying to keep the economy going?
254	8500?????
254	That's twice as valuable as your car!
254	Can't you get a used one for $3000?
255	George, The probability of building a house this year is increasing.
255	I have shifted to a slightly different plan.
255	There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously.
255	Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.
255	One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.
255	The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.
255	This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living.
255	I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.
255	The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts.
255	I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.
255	I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.
255	I would like to come and visit you again this month.
255	If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.
255	I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for.
255	I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.
255	Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.
255	Phillip Allen PS.
255	Channel 2 in Houston ran a story yesterday (Feb. 2) about a home in Kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls.
255	You should try their website or call the station to get the full story.
255	It would makes a good case for breathable walls.
256	Got your email.
256	I will let Jacques know.
256	I guess we can work out the finer points next week.
256	The bank here in Houston is dealing with their auditors this week, so unfortunately I did not hear from them this week.
256	The are promising to have some feedback by Monday.
256	I will let you know as soon as I hear from them.
256	Phillip
257	Susan hours are out of hand.
257	We need to find a solution.
257	Let's meet on Monday to assess the issue Phillip
258	I would like to go to this meeting.
258	Can you arrange it?
259	Lucy, Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the "Rent Due" column.
259	The other questions I had about last week's rent are: #15 Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.
259	What is going on?
259	#25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.
259	Why?
259	I spoke to Jeff Smith.
259	I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger.
259	He was not trying to insult you.
259	I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property.
259	Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.
259	Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now.
259	I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.
259	As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation.
259	The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.
259	Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.
259	It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.
259	I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property.
259	I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time.
259	We can look at again later in the year.
259	I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.
259	Phillip
260	Susan, Raised your issue to Sally Beck.
260	Larry is going to spend time with you to see if he can live without any reports.
260	Also some IT help should be on the way.
260	Phillip
261	Jeff, I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.
261	There are several reasons that I won't commit to this.
261	Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns.
261	What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.
261	The existing note does not come due until September 2009.
261	That is a long time.
261	The buyer may have sold the property.
261	Interest rates may be lower.
261	I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note.
261	Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far.
261	Can you clarify the dates in the contract.
261	Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?
261	Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.
261	I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer.
261	If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list.
261	Email or call me later today.
261	Phillip
262	Jeff, My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.
262	Therefore, I could take a sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.
262	This would still only require $75K cash from the buyer.
262	After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around $20K cash.
262	You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email.
262	Do you want to give the New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.
262	Phillip
263	Send it to Ina Rangel she can forward it to appropriate traders.
263	There are too many to list individually
264	Jacques, Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?
264	The key business points are: 1.
264	Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2.
264	Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3.
264	The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.
264	4.
264	All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?
264	5.
264	60/40 split favoring the investors.
264	With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs.
264	Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.
264	Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping.
264	The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours.
264	We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted.
264	Let me know if you can draft these agreements.
264	The GP issue may need some tweaking.
264	Phillip Allen
265	I will email you an updated operating statement with Nov and Dec tomorrow morning.
265	What did the seguin doctor think of the place.
265	How much could I get the stagecoach appraised for?
265	Do you still do appraisals?
265	Could it be valued on an 11 or 12 cap?
266	Lucy, Here is the rentroll for this Friday.
266	Sorry it is so late.
266	There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.
266	1.
266	I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.
266	The missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.
266	2.
266	#1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?
266	3.
266	#3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?
266	7.
266	#15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?
266	My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.
266	You may have sent me a message over the "chat" line that I don't remember on some of these.
266	I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit.
266	Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.
266	Tried to call Wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.
266	Will try again today.
266	I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.
266	Did you meet them?
266	If so, what did you think?
266	Phillip
267	Lucy, Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps.
267	I wrote it as if it were from you.
267	It should come from the manager.
267	It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there unit is when they move in. This needs to be written in on their lease.
267	When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.
267	Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.
267	You guys can make changes if you need to.
267	Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators.
267	We have to get this done next week.
267	I will email you a form to use to record serial numbers.
267	The prospective buyers want this information plus we need it for our records.
267	Something to look forward to.
267	It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.
267	Please have my Dad call me with the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.
267	He will know what I mean.
267	Talk to you later, Phillip
268	Colleen, I checked the transport model and found the following extrinsic values on January 2nd versus February 11: If these numbers are correct, then we haven't increased the extrinsic value since the beginning of the year.
268	Can you confirm that I am looking at the right numbers?
268	Phillip
269	Thanks for the website.
270	no.
270	I am on msn messenger.
271	Lucy, Here is the 2/2 rentroll.
271	The total does not equal the bank deposit.
271	Your earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.
271	But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.
271	If the answer to this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and send it back.
271	Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.
271	I will probably send you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll.
271	Let's get this stuff clean today.
271	Phillip
272	Lee, My fax number is 713-646-2391.
272	Please fax me a loan application that I can pass on to the buyer.
272	Phillip Allen
273	Lucy, Thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file.
273	Moving on to 2/9, here are some questions: #1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110.
273	I can't tell if he still owes $47 on his deposit.
273	#13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140.
273	#15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95.
273	Hopefully, he won't have a bad reaction.
273	#20b Missed rent?
273	#26 Has she paid any deposit or rent?
273	#27 Missed rent?
274	Forward Reg Dickson's resume to Ted Bland for consideration for the trading track program.
274	He is overqualified and I'm sure too expensive to fill the scheduling position I have available.
274	I will work with Cournie Parker to evaluate the other resumes.
274	Phillip
275	Jeff, Here is the application from SPB.
275	I guess they want to use the same form as a new loan application.
275	I have a call in to Lee O'Donnell to try to find out if there is a shorter form.
275	What do I need to be providing to the buyer according to the contract.
275	I was planning on bringing a copy of the survey and a rentroll including deposits on Monday.
275	Please let me know this morning what else I should be putting together.
275	Phillip
276	Lee, Can you provide me with a copy of the original loan and a copy of the original appraisal.
276	My fax number is 713-646-2391 Mailing address: 8855 Merlin Ct, Houston, TX 77055 Thank you, Phillip Allen
277	Andrew, Here is an asset statement.
277	I will mail my 98 & 99 Tax returns plus a 2000 W2.
277	Is this sufficient?
277	Phillip Allen 713-463-8626 home
278	I would like to have a copy of the appraisal.
278	See you Monday at 2.
278	Phillip
279	Jeanie, Lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into part time.
279	Nice confidentiality.
279	Since I have already gotten the grief, it would be nice to get some useful information.
279	What did you find out about part time, leave of absences, and sabbaticals?
279	My interest is for 2002.
279	Phillip
280	George, Please send the latest cost estimates when you get a chance this morning.
280	Phillip
281	After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit.
281	Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials.
281	Then there is a layer of "construction management" fees of 10%.
281	There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money.
281	But I think the majority of it is profit.
281	Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million.
281	Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.
281	After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?
281	We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs.
281	George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using.
281	I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included.
281	George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.
281	I will review and let you know what I think.
281	The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.
281	They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process.
281	Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for only true costs + 1.4 million.
281	Phillip
282	yes please
283	That would we very helpful.
283	Thanks, Phillip
284	The spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles.
284	Would you consider placing several spinning bikes out with the other exercise equipment and running a spinning video on the TV's.
284	I think the equipment would be used much more.
284	Members could just jump on a bike and follow the video any time of day.
284	Let me know if this is possible.
284	Phillip Allen
285	Tomorrow is fine.
285	Talk to you then.
285	Phillip
286	You can fax it anytime.
286	But I saved the spreadsheets from the previous estimates.
286	What will be different in the fax?
287	George, The numbers on your fax don't agree to the first estimate that I am using.
287	Here are the two files I used.
287	Phillip
288	George, I can take a day off the week I get back from vacation.
288	Any day between March 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference.
288	Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough.
288	The items I listed moved dramatically.
288	Also, some of the questions were just clarification of what was in a number.
288	Let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow morning.
288	Phillip
289	Lucy, Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll: #2 Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.
289	Her move in date was 2/6.
289	It is not on any rentroll that I can see.
289	#9 Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she will start paying on #9 #15 Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.
289	Stop trying to collect the $95 in question.
289	#33 Missed rent.
289	Are they still there?
289	#26 I see that she paid a deposit.
289	But the file says she moved in on 1/30.
289	Has she ever paid rent?
289	I can't find any on the last three deposits.
289	#44 Have the paid for February?
289	There is no payment since the beginning of the year.
289	#33 You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?
289	The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.
289	I need you to figure these out immediately.
289	I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll in case you need to research these questions.
289	I will not be in the office next week.
289	If I can get connected you might be able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.
289	Otherwise try and work with Gary on pressing issues.
289	If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.
289	Phillip
290	Please find attached the pro formas for the project in San Marcos.
290	Thanks again.
291	Don, I was out last week.
291	Regarding the Montana supply, you can refer them to Mark Whitt in Denver.
291	Let me know when you want to have the other meeting.
291	Also, we frequently give out quotes to mid-marketers on Fred LaGrasta's desk or Enron marketers in New York where the customer is EES.
291	I don't understand why your people don't contact the desk directly.
291	Phillip
292	I have not received the aircard 300 yet.
292	Phillip
293	John, Did you put Frank Hayden up to this?
293	If this decision is up to me I wouldconsider authorizing Mike G., Frank E., Keith H. and myself to trade westpower.
293	What do you think?
293	Phillip
294	I was not going to do the MS this year.
294	Thanks for the offer though.
294	All is well here.
294	We went to Colorado last week and the kids learned to ski.
294	Work is same as always.
294	How are things going at New Power?
294	Is there any potential?
294	Phillip
295	Daryl, Here is the file that includes the proforma, unit costs, and comps.
295	This file was prepared by the builder/developer.
295	The architect that has begun to work on the project is Kipp Flores.
295	They are in Austin.
295	Thank you for your time this evening.
295	Your comments were very helpful.
295	I appreciate you and Greg taking a look at this project.
295	Phillip Allen
296	I faxed you the signed amendment.
297	I just refaxed.
297	Please confirm receipt
298	Reagan, Here is the cost estimate and proforma prepared by George and Larry.
298	I am faxing the site plan, elevation, and floor plans.
298	Phillip
299	Darrell, Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his excessively high cost estimates.
299	As he did not have the funds to take on the land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.
299	I would like to proceed and develop the property.
299	My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.
299	I would also like to compare construction and development services between what you can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.
299	Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to be in order.
299	I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural work to date.
299	Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is Quattro Consultants out of Buda.
299	Let me know if you have an opinion about either.
299	I look forward to working with you.
299	Talk to you tomorrow.
299	Phillip
300	Lucy, Here is a rentroll for this week.
300	What is the outstanding balance on #1.
300	It looks like 190 + 110(this week)300.
300	I don't think we should make him pay late fees if can't communicate clearly.
300	#2 still owe deposit?
300	#9 What day will she pay and is she going to pay monthly or biweekly.
300	Have a good weekend.
300	I will talk to you next week.
300	In about two weeks we should know for sure if these buyers are going to buy the property.
300	I will keep you informed.
300	Phillip
301	George, I didn't receive the information on work completed or started.
301	Please send it this morning.
301	We haven't discussed how to proceed with the land.
301	The easiest treatment would be just to deed it to us.
301	However, it might be more advantageous to convey the partnership.
301	Also, I would like to speak to Hugo today.
301	I didn't find a Quattro Engineering in Buda.
301	Can you put me in contact with him.
301	Talk to you later.
301	Phillip
302	Jacques, George finally sent me some information.
302	Please look over his email.
302	He wants us to buy him out.
302	Keith and I think this is a joke.
302	We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward.
302	I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us.
302	I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market.
302	My version of a buyout is attached.
302	I need your expert advise.
302	I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose.
302	Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?
302	Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance.
302	There isn't any time to waste so I want to respond to their offer asap.
302	Call me with your thoughts.
302	Phillip
303	Here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format.
303	The summary presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions.
304	Gentlemen, Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date.
304	I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.
304	The property is still in two parcels.
304	Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.
304	He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey.
304	In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.
304	Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete.
304	The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed.
304	We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.
304	If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.
304	Hugo's number is 512-295-8052.
304	I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions.
304	I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that.
304	Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used.
304	Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.
304	We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.
304	Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward.
304	Phillip
305	Lucy, Somehow my email account lost the rentroll you sent me on Tuesday.
305	Please resend it and I will roll it for this week this morning.
305	Phillip
306	Thanks for the information.
306	It would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned.
306	I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this January.
306	I have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock.
306	I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be kept in enron stock (50%).
306	Are you saying that all the previous grants have fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?
306	Thank you for looking into this issue.
306	Phillip
307	I also need to know the base salaries of Jay Reitmeyer and Monique Sanchez.
307	They are doing the same job as Matt.
308	Lucy, Here is the rentroll.
308	My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.
308	Any special reasons?
308	It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.
308	If you want to run an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.
308	I will write you a letter of recommendation.
308	When do you need it?
308	You can use me as a reference.
308	In the next two weeks we should really have a good idea whether the sale is going through.
308	Phillip
309	Jacques, I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time.
309	It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal).
309	One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied.
309	I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.
309	Can you help clear this up.
309	Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.
309	Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.
309	On the other hand, conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was clean.
309	What is your inclination?
309	Call as soon as you have a chance to review.
309	Phillip
310	I realize you are disappointed about the project.
310	It is not my desire for you to be left with out of pocket expenses.
310	The only item from your list that I need further clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.
310	You mentioned that this was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash investment in the land.
310	I agree that you should be refunded any cash investment.
310	My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the closing statement or on some other document.
310	Phillip
311	Jacques, Still trying to close the loop on the $15,000 of extensions.
311	Assuming that it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents need to be completed to convey the partnership done.
311	I need to work with the engineer and architect to get things moving.
311	I am planning on writing a personal check to the engineer while I am setting up new accounts.
311	Let me know if there is a reason I should not do this.
311	Thanks for all your help so far.
311	Between your connections and expertise in structuring the loan, you saved us from getting into a bad deal.
311	Phillip
312	Ina, Can you help me approve this request?
312	Phillip
313	Jacques, Here is Larry Lewter's response to my request for more documentation to support the $15,000.
313	As you will read below, it is no longer an issue.
313	I think that was the last issue to resolve.
313	Phillip
314	Greg, just a note to let you know I will be out of the office Wed(3/21) until Thurs(3/23).
314	The kids are on spring break.
314	I will be in San Marcos and you can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com.
314	I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a check and give him the green light to file for replatting.
314	What will change if we want to try and complete the project in phases.
314	Does he need to change what he is going to submit to the city.
314	I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.
314	He was contracted to complete the soils study.
314	He says he will be done with his report by the end of the week.
314	I don't know who needs this report.
314	I told Gordon you might call to inquire about what work he performed.
314	His number is 512-930-5832.
314	We spoke on the phone about most of these issues.
314	Talk to you later.
314	Phillip
315	Larry, Jacques has been working with Claudia.
315	I will check his progress this morning and let you know.
315	Phillip
316	Steve, Try bmckay@enron.com or Brad.McKay@enron.com
317	Jacques, The agreement looks fine.
317	My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that "the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project".
317	Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required.
317	Did I loan them $1,300,000?
317	I thought it was less.
317	Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.
317	Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants.
317	I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.
317	I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.
317	The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.
317	Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.
317	Phillip
318	keith holst sent you an email with the details.
319	Greg, Something that I forgot to ask you.
319	Do you know if Hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks?
319	Also let me know about the parking.
319	The builder in San Marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.
319	The townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem.
319	They probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.
319	Phillip
320	Reagan, Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.
320	Specific features include: Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs Wood stairs Two story porches on front and rear Granite counters in kitchens and baths Tile floors in upstairs baths Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers) Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths Solid wood interior doors Windows fully trimmed Crown molding in downstairs living areas 2x6 wall on west side Undecided items include: Vinyl or Aluminum windows Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim or rough white brick on 3-4 sides I have faxed you the floor plans.
320	The dimensions may be to small to read.
320	The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.
320	For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, but only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.
320	Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?
320	It is basically a box with a simple roof line.
320	Call me if you have any questions.
320	713-853-7041.
320	Phillip
321	John, Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of course).
321	He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.
321	His existing contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.
321	He still wants to receive this payment.
321	Phillip
322	Please provide a temporary id Phillip
323	Greg, Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates: Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable) What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?
323	Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?
323	You mentioned 2% Why is profit only 4%?
323	Why are the architect fees up to $200K.
323	I thought they would be $80K.
323	What is the $617K of profit allowance?
323	Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost?
323	Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?
323	That seems very high?
323	Who receives the 2 points?
323	How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?
323	Where is your 1%?
323	Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?
323	What is the status on the operating pro forma?
323	My back of the envelope puts expenses.
323	After debt service that would only leave $122K.
323	The coverage would only be 1.16.
323	Talk to you this afternoon.
323	Phillip
324	Jacques, Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect?
324	They have both sent me agreements.
324	The only payment that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.
324	I have written personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the engineer.
324	I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership.
324	I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me.
324	Should I wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.
324	Let me know what you think.
324	Phillip
325	Larry, Jacques has sent a document to Claudia for your review.
325	Just dropping you a line to confirm that you have seen it.
325	Phillip
326	Reagan, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.
326	Below is a list of questions on the specs: 1.
326	Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?
326	Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same?
326	2.
326	What type of floor joist would be used?
326	2x12 or some sort of factory joist?
326	3.
326	What type for roof framing?
326	On site built rafters?
326	or engineered trusses?
326	4.
326	Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?
326	What type of insulation in floors and ceiling?
326	Batts or blown?
326	Fiberglass or Cellulose?
326	5.
326	Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?
326	6.
326	Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?
326	I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool.
326	7.
326	Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking?
326	Double plywood or hardi board underlay?
326	8.
326	On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?
326	I was thinking a partial one out of iron.
326	Only about 5 feet.
326	9.
326	I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs.
326	A pedestal sink would probably work.
326	10.
326	Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?
326	I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.
326	11.
326	1 or 2 A/C units?
326	I am assuming 2.
326	12.
326	Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?
326	13.
326	No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?
326	14.
326	Exterior porches included in bid?
326	Cedar decking on upstairs?
326	Iron railings?
326	15.
326	What type of construction contract would you use?
326	Fixed price except for change orders?
326	I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start.
326	I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.
326	I am going to call Cary Kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.
326	Phillip I
327	no problem
328	Cary, Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.
328	I was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley.
328	A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.
328	More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
328	Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.
328	I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
328	That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.
328	Also the front porch would be smaller.
328	I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.
328	I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.
328	I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.
328	As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft.
328	I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.
328	Phillip Allen
329	Reagan, I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.
329	Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?
329	What role would you play in obtaining financing?
329	Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans?
329	Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet.
329	I have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.
329	I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.
329	As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.
329	I am not thrilled about such a low return.
329	I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.
329	Any ideas?
329	I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections.
329	I am not discounting those services.
329	I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.
329	Phillip
330	Jacques I am out of the office for the rest of the week.
330	Have you ever seen anyone miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?
330	I assure you this is unusual for me.
330	Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.
330	Call me on my cell phone if you need me.
330	Phillip
331	My location is eb3210C
332	Jacques, The assets and liabilities that we are willing to assume are listed below: Assets: Land Preliminary Architecture Design-Kipp Flores Architects Preliminary Engineering-Cuatro Consultants, Ltd. Soils Study-Kohutek Engineering & Testing, Inc. Appraisal-Atrium Real Estate Services Liabilities: Note to Phillip Allen Outstanding Invoices to Kipp Flores, Cuatro, and Kohutek Additional Consideration or Concessions Forgive interest due Reimburse $3,500 for appraisal and $2,375 for partial payment to engineer Let me know if you need more detail.
332	Phillip
333	Do you have a distribution list to send this to all the traders.
333	Phillip
334	Thanks for the response.
334	I think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step.
334	I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the floor plan.
334	He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.
334	He took my plan and improved it.
334	I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.
334	While he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list.
334	Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.
334	I will be in San Marcos on Friday April 13th.
334	Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through that day?
334	Also can you provide some references?
334	Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust your bid.
334	Phillip
335	John, Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.
335	Keith said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.
335	I still believe Frank should receive the same signing incentives as Keith.
335	Phillip
336	Jacques, The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit "B" are as follows: Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 is outstanding.
336	George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this amount.
336	The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 appraisal and $2,375 engineering).
336	I couldn't find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.
336	Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the sellers to be executed.
336	Phillip
337	Reagan, I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on Friday, April 13th.
337	However, my closing has been postponed.
337	As I mentioned I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get back in touch with you once he is finished.
337	Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager from San Antonio.
337	For my first development project, I feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining FHA financing.
337	We are working with Kipp Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.
337	Your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.
337	I am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships.
337	I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan.
337	Phillip Allen
338	Jed, Thanks for the response.
338	Phillip Allen
339	Thanks for your help.
340	Lucy, Here is the rentroll from last friday.
340	The closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday April 20th.
340	If you can stay on until April 20th that would be helpful.
340	If you have made other commitments I understand.
340	Gary is planning to put an A/C in #35.
340	You can give out my work numer (713) 853-7041 Phillip
341	Bruce, Thank you for your bid.
341	I have decided on a floor plan.
341	I am going to have an architect in Austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed specification list.
341	I will send you that detailed plan and spec list when complete for a final bid.
341	Probably in early to mid June.
341	Phillip
342	Lucy, The spreadsheet looks fine to me.
342	Phillip
343	Larry, It sounds like Claudia and Jacques are almost finished with the documents.
343	There is one item of which I was unsure.
343	Was an environmental report prepared before the original purchase?
343	If yes, shouldn't it be listed as an asset of the partnership and your costs be recovered?
343	Phillip
344	I will try and get my dad to take the appraiser into a couple of units.
344	Let me know the day and time.
344	Phillip
345	Here is a simplistic spreadsheet.
345	I didn't drop in the new generation yet, but even without the new plants it looks like Q3 is no worse than last year.
345	Can you take a look and get back to me with the bullish case?
345	thanks, Phillip
346	I will email you with the insurance info tomorrow.
347	The insurance company is: Central Insurance Agency, Inc Policy #CBI420478 Contact: Jeanette Peterson The actual policy is signed by Vista Insurance Partners.
347	Please try and schedule the appraiser for sometime after 1 p.m.
347	so my Dad can walk him around.
347	I will be out of town on Tuesday.
347	What else do we need to get done before closing?
347	Phillip
348	How am I to send them the money for the silent second?
348	Regular mail, overnight, wire transfer?
348	I don't see how their bank will make the funds available by Friday unless I wire the money.
348	If that is what I need to do please send wiring instructions.
349	Ina, Can you please forward the presentation to Mog.
349	Phillip
350	Jeff, I am in the office today.
350	Any isssues to deal with for the stagecoach?
350	Phillip
351	The topic will the the western natural gas market.
351	I may have overhead slides.
351	I will bring handouts.
352	Chad, Call Ted Bland about the trading track program.
352	All the desks are trying to use this program to train analysts to be traders.
352	Your experience should help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary.
352	Unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk.
352	Phillip
353	Ina, Can you please forward the presentation to Mog.
353	Phillip
354	I still use this service
355	I still use this service
356	Johnnie, Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.
356	I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.
356	I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.
356	In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.
356	The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your framers install them may have to be considered.
356	However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.
356	I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.
356	I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.
356	Please email your cost estimates when complete.
356	Thank you, Phillip Allen
357	I think Chad deserves an interview.
358	Andrea, After reviewing Bryan Hull's resume, I think he would be best suited for the trading track program.
358	Please forward his resume to Karen Buckley.
358	Phillip
359	I think Chad deserves an interview.
360	Have him send his resume to Karen Buckley in HR.
360	There is a new round of trading track interviews in May.
361	Send his resume to Karen Buckley.
361	I believe there will be a full round of interviews for the trading track in May.
362	Frank, The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.
362	Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.
362	Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.
362	If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.
362	Phillip
363	it works.
363	thank you
364	Griff, It is bidweek again.
364	I need to provide view only ID's to the two major publications that post the monthly indeces.
364	Please email an id and password to the following: Dexter Steis at Natural Gas Intelligence- dexter@intelligencepress.com Liane Kucher at Inside Ferc- lkuch@mh.com Bidweek is under way so it is critical that these id's are sent out asap.
364	Thanks for your help, Phillip Allen
365	I just spoke to the insurance company.
365	They are going to cancel and prorate my policy and work with the Kuo's to issue a new policy.
366	it works.
366	thank you
367	Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?
367	Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?
368	Gary, Here is a photograph of a similar house.
368	The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 41' Deep for the living area.
368	In addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.
368	A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.
368	The living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch.
368	I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow and fax you a copy.
368	Phillip Allen
369	Ned, Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.
369	The following assumptions were made to establish our bid: 5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.
369	Also an undiscounted June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.
369	Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions: $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).
369	Demand charges only.
369	I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.
369	Please call or email with comments.
369	Phillip Allen
370	I would look at properties in San Antonio or Dallas.
371	Ray, Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.
371	Which delivery points from which publication will be used?
371	Basically, can you help us get any clarification on the language "the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California"?
371	Phillip
372	Gary, I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.
372	According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.
372	Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.
372	I believe he has sent you my plans.
372	They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.
372	Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?
372	If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?
372	Thank you for your time.
372	I am excited about potentially using your product.
372	Phillip Allen
373	I would look at properties in San Antonio or Dallas.
374	Send to Karen Buckley.
374	Trading track interview to be conducted in May.
375	Tim, Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.
375	He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.
375	On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.
375	It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.
375	Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.
375	The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.
375	Can you email or call with some additional insight?
375	Thank you, Phillip
376	Send to Karen Buckley.
376	Trading track interview to be conducted in May.
377	Alan, You should have received updated numbers from Keith Holst.
377	Call me if you did not receive them.
377	Phillip
378	Jim, Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing California this week?
378	Can you make sure the gas desk is included.
378	Phillip
379	Reagan, Just wanted to give you an update.
379	I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.
379	Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.
379	At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.
379	Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.
379	Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.
379	Phillip
380	Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.
380	Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.
380	I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.
380	I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.
380	As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.
380	Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.
380	The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.
380	My suggestion for where to go is Austin.
380	Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.
380	Flying somewhere takes too much time.
381	Tim, mike grigsby is having problems with accessing the west power site.
381	Can you please make sure he has an active password.
381	Thank you, Phillip
382	Can you guys coordinate to make sure someone listens to this conference call each week.
382	Tara from the fundamental group was recording these calls when they happened every day.
382	Phillip
383	The west desk would like 2 analysts.
384	The west desk would like 2 analysts.
385	Jeff, Jacques Craig will draw up a release.
385	What is the status on the quote from Wade?
385	Phillip
386	Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.
386	I am expecting to pay something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.
386	I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done.
386	It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding.
386	If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify.
386	Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.
386	If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities.
386	Hopefully things will go smoothly.
386	Phillip
387	Here is our forecast
388	Here is our forecast
389	thanks for the update.
389	This is very useful.
390	Jeff, I received the fax from Velasquez Masonry for $11,000.
390	He is proposing to do work on nine buildings.
390	From the memo from the city it sounds like 33,34,35, and 42 are the units that are at risk for collapse.
390	I don't want to pay for any discretionary work.
390	Also, I am still waiting for a quote from another mason.
390	I am willing to offer $5,000 toward the repair and removal of rock in return for the release prepared by Jacques.
390	With regard to the utilities I want to have them transferred on Monday the 21st.
390	That will be one month that the utilities have been in my name.
390	It needs to be clear that I will net that month's electric and water against the $5,000 for the rock.
390	If she is willing to take the money for repairs we should be able to wrap things up immediately.
390	If not we will have to continue negotiations, but the utilities still need to be transferred.
390	Phillip
391	Tim, Thanks for the update.
392	That is fine
393	Jim, I read through the data request.
393	We cannot provide several of the items that they requested.
393	We do not break out our california deals into separate transport and commodity components.
393	Also the majortiy of our buys and sells net out without exchanging actual transport contract numbers.
393	I know in the past Becky C. has worked with our back office to pull the data directly from the system.
393	Let me know if I need to do anything to assist gathering the data.
393	I would like to review the final product before it is submitted.
393	Phillip
394	Kristin, Have you seen any studies associated with the opinions that the $12B is not enough.
394	I would like to see some calculations that multiply the net short by the power cost and compare that to the amounts collected through rates.
394	Phillip
395	Adrianne, Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, Emil Carlsson and Thomas Considine.
395	Emil is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading position.
395	I would recommend bringing Emil to Houston for further interviews based on his technical knowledge.
395	The biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation.
395	Thomas was working as an equity market maker.
395	He is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise.
395	He is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades.
395	The trading track would be an excellent match for his desires.
395	I would also recommend bringing Thomas to Houston for further consideration.
395	Phillip
396	John, Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this.
396	However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime.
396	I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.
396	The punishment does not fit the crime.
396	What message are you trying to send?
396	The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.
396	Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.
396	I know these are not your intended messages.
396	I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.
396	We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.
396	My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.
396	The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.
396	Please consider these suggestions.
396	We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.
396	Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.
396	Phillip
397	Sue, Tim Belden forwarded this message to me.
397	Can you please add Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst, Frank Ermis, and myself to your email distribution list.
397	We are all holding significant gas positions in California and are greatly affected by any gas or power developments withing the state.
397	With regard to Socal's comments, do you have any additional information?
397	This is quite a 180 from the presentations that Socal has been giving to the CPUC and at other forums.
397	Until now they have been consistently stating that they will have plenty of gas.
397	Phillip
398	Please remove from email.
398	Phillip Allen
399	Jeff, The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.
399	You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.
399	It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.
399	Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.
399	But I have not received payment on either.
399	Let's try and wrap this up this week.
399	Phillip
400	Is AMF willing to put up the additional earnest money and acknowledge June 29th as the day they were supposed to close or do they believe they are honoring the contract by closing on July 18th?
400	Of course, I would prefer to close as soon as possible.
400	I received the fax from the stagecoach.
400	I am willing to pay any small expenses like the phone bill incurred prior to April 20th.
400	What is the status of the release and the utility transfer?
400	Phillip
401	Do you want to send someone to this?
402	Tim, I know you looked into this before but we are still having issues with Mike Grigsby's access to the west power site.
402	He can view some parts of the website but cannot view the heatrate information under the testing tab.
402	Does he have some sort of reduced access?
402	Our IT (Collin) looked at Mike's access but claimed that it must be on the Portland end.
402	Sorry to bother you with this again, but can you help?
402	Phillip
403	Stephanie, I need to be able to trade US Gas Spreads.
403	Specifically the new west region products spreading malin and pg&e vs. socal.
403	Please make this change and call me back this morning.
403	Thank you, Phillip
404	please send me their resumes
405	Karen, Can you tell me when Matt Smith and Jason Wolfe are scheduled to move to new rotations?
405	Also what are their next assignments.
405	I would like to move Matt Smith into an assistant trading rotation and have Jason move in to Matt's current rotation in the fundamentals group.
405	Phillip
406	Greg, I typed up this resume from scratch in 10 minutes.
406	Will it do?
406	If you work for the same company for 8 years your resume tends to get dusty.
406	Let me know if I need to beef it up or if I need to include any financial information.
406	I wanted you to review it before I sent it to Montez.
406	If it is ok please forward to Montez.
407	Jeanie, Please change Janie Tholt's ranking to a 3.
408	Jeff, I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter.
408	Regarding the utilities, you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.
408	I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.
408	I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.
408	The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.
408	Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.
408	Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.
408	The utilities are already in her name.
408	In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.
408	Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.
408	Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.
408	I expect to have that done by Friday.
408	I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday.
408	As far as the utilities go, I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand.
408	I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.
408	Phillip
409	Faith, Two changes need to be made to the list.
409	First, Jason Wolfe is a trading track analyst on the west desk.
409	Second, Matt Lenhart should be an Associate as his duties and responsibilities are identical to Monique S, Jay R., and Randy G. I don't know if this change can be made administatively or if I need to bring this up during PRC.
409	Please let me know.
409	Phillip
410	Jeff, Here is a short letter that indicates I will give consent contingent to the items we discussed.
410	I didn't make any reference to why I took the utilities out of my name.
410	I left that for you to explain to her that we need to have a cutoff date so we can calculate the final amount.
410	I hope you can make her understand that I have not been obligated to keep these in my name for some time.
410	Since my attorney is out of town until Monday and I doubt that she has all the documents in place to actually place the property in a limited partnership (certainly not the 1st lienholders consent) we will have to work together next week.
410	If you want to modify this letter let me know.
410	I am also faxing you a sign copy.
410	Phillip
411	Thanks for the update on the foundation design.
411	The clubhouse floorplan looks good.
412	Carlos, Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?
412	I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.
412	Here is my situation.
412	I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.
412	I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.
412	I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.
412	See calculations below: Sales price: 2,100,000 Purchase price 1,200,000 Profit 400,000 The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.
412	I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.
412	I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify.
412	First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.
412	I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.
412	We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.
412	The loan still exist.
412	I am an 80% limited partner.
412	Another investor is the other limited partner.
412	We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.
412	We intend to develop the property.
412	Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?
412	Second, I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.
412	I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.
412	I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.
412	If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.
412	My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.
412	Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?
412	Thank you in advance for your help.
412	Phillip Allen 8855 Merlin Ct
413	Jen, Can you send copies of all the california power contracts to me?
413	Thank you, Phillip
414	Jeff, I understand you spoke to Jacques Craig about the consent and assignment documents.
414	Maybe the attorneys can work this out faster than we have.
414	I spoke to the city this morning and the final bills are to be mailed out today.
414	So I should have an amount on Wednesday.
414	I will email and fax the amount and the supporting bills as soon as possible.
414	Maybe we can close out the release this week and consent to the assignment pending 1st lien holder approval.
414	I have a favor to ask you.
414	I received the check from Pauline that was due May 20th.
414	However, I have misplaced it.
414	Can you ask her to put a stop on her 1st check and send me another (net of any costs for the stop payment).
414	If you would prefer for me to call her myself, I will.
414	It seems that communicating through you is working well.
414	Thanks for all your help.
414	Phillip
415	I will send checks directly to the vendor for any bills pre 4/20.
415	I will fax you copies.
415	I will also try and get the payphone transferred.
416	John, Two items: 1.
416	I spoke to John McKay about Sumas.
416	His views seem well thought out.
416	He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.
416	See attached spreadsheet.
416	In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.
416	But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.
416	Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40 His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand.
416	See attached spreadsheet.
416	Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't support that premium.
416	In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.
416	2.
416	I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues.
417	Is there any chance that the request to gather data on financial trades is implemented?
417	Our understanding was that the commission had no jurisdiction over financial markets.
418	Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE or just above market.
418	If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?
418	If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.
418	Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.
418	Phillip
419	David, This note is to give you my feedback on Jeanie Slone.
419	She has been extremely helpful with all personnel issues during the last six months.
419	Without exception she has satisfied any request I have made of her.
419	She has done an excellent job dealing with performance reviews (both good and bad), salary, and title issues.
419	Phillip
420	the hr needs of the gas trading floor
421	Please keep me on your list.
422	Jeff, Here is the recap of the utilities I have paid since closing.
422	I am going to send the original utility bills to the Kuo's.
423	I have attached a summary of the utilities I paid since the 4/20 closing.
423	The total is $7,328.87.
423	Do you need to incorporate this number is the release or can I just net this amount against the $11,000 and pay them the difference.
423	Do they have an executable copy of the release?
423	I would like to settle up on the repairs, utilities, and the release now.
423	I don't want these issues to get bogged down with the 1st lienholders approval of any assignments.
423	Phillip
424	Becky, How about Wednesday morning at 10:30 am?
424	Phillip
425	Would we have interest in any storage capacity in the proposed facility?
426	Improving the PRC process.
426	Customizing it more for the trading group.
426	Figure out some creative ways to compare trading performance.
426	Add profitability and consistency other other trading measures.
426	Also incorporate a system of handicapping performance of traders in different markets.
427	Ina, Can you get a conference room on 32 for this meeting on Wednesday and let Becky Cantrell know.
427	thank you
428	Jacques, Have you received the assignment letter from Marcus Kolb.
428	This letter makes it sound like the assumption is just between the Kuo's and Success Real Estate.
428	Don't they need something signed from Southern Pacific Bank?
428	I certainly don't plan on signing any assignment documents before the release is signed and settled.
428	Has their attorney contacted you with any revisions?
428	Is the ball in their court?
428	Phillip
429	Greg, I noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway.
429	First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.
429	Second, part of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for "seniors".
429	I would like to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assisted living).
429	Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.
429	As I have mentioned, my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over the next two years.
429	At the current rate that amount would cover the equity requirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest partner like Keith.
429	Here is the article: Sector 2 plan geets boost from council By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter Home and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised future land use plan to consult for development in the area.
429	The San Marcos City Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 square mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable and appropriate for the region.
429	Significant to the revisions are those affecting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corner of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).
429	Weatherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of various city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner says were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two plan.
429	Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no direct effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density residential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven additional acres of low density residential.
429	In addition, the total eight acres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is suggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing development in the revised future land use plan.
429	The total 10 acres of commercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to "community commercial" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ensure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete with buffering and landscaping.
429	A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed to separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan.
429	However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew some concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may pose on the busy state highway.
429	Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing the proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Avenue.
429	While the state highway department and city would have input into the plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.
429	Council member Jane Hughson supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sector Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in the area as development proceeds.
429	"I'd rather say "no' and if someone comes us with a really good idea, look at it then," Hughson said. Councilman Ed Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of the curb cut. "It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happen there," Mihalkanin said. A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclude curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the meeting. Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from several residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good compromise. Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active critic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concerning the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests of the city as a whole. "This is not a victory for one side or the other," said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to Weatherford's initial plans for his property, "but a victory for the City of San Marcos.
429	We started out with all R-1...we've come a long way."
430	Kay, I sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks.
430	The main idea was that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying.
430	I had lost your email so I sent it to Gary and asked him to forward it to you.
430	I guess he is technology challenged.
430	The article was just one analyst's opinion.
430	He can find dozens of articles just like it online.
430	It was not important.
430	On a different note, Kelsey is at T Bar M camp this week.
430	Heather is very anxious about this.
430	The only info we get is through the camp's website.
430	Each day they post candid pictures from the prior day.
430	We scan through to try and spot Kelsey.
430	So far we have found her in one picture each day.
430	It is kind of fun trying to find her.
430	If you want to give it a try, go to their website at www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml .
430	Click on sports camp parent connection.
430	There are a few paragraphs about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day.
430	See if you can find her.
430	Pat and Gary's house looks like it is taking shape fast.
430	The Meckels seem to do good work.
430	I might have to reconsider using them for our house.
430	We should be in town Friday.
430	We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday.
430	See you soon.
430	Keith
431	Jacques, Glad to hear their attorney contacted you.
431	I agree that we will not consent to the assignment unless the release and utility issue are resolved, but I would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the 1st lienholder to consent.
431	Can we wrap up those issues and sign some sort of agreement to consent subject to Southern Pacific Bank's consent.
431	Phillip
432	Matt, Make sure this is included in your long term forecast.
433	Barry, Mike and I are going to meet with John L. at 2:30 to officially work out the details of Mike's succession as desk head.
433	We will probably announce to the group by the end of the week.
433	Phillip
434	Michael, I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options.
434	Unfortunately, they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future.
434	The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place.
434	They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options.
434	It was worth a try.
434	Phillip
435	Please add the following names to the mailing list: Mike Grigsby, Frank Ermis, Keith Holst, Matt Smith, Janie Tholt
436	Mike, I sent Leslie a note to include you and others on the desk on the distribution list.
437	Please approve Ina Rangel for a corporate American Express.

440	Jay, Can you set up one more simulated account with access to all products for the west desk.
440	Thank you, Phillip Allen
441	Jay, My message was confusing.
441	I needed one more id that has access to all products.
441	It is for the use of someone on the West Desk.
441	I do not need an ID that can only trade the West region.
441	If possible, please modify simtrader7.
441	Thank you, Phillip
442	Bill, Have not received the forms yet.
442	I will confirm receipt.

446	I am pulling together all the organizational documents for the partnership.
446	Phillip
447	Jacques, Here is the payoff info for the unsecured note: Assuming the note is paid before the 7/20 payment is due: $36,523 + $7/day accrued interest since 6/20.
447	For example, if paid on 7/18 the balance would be $36,719.
447	If the Kuo's make the payment due on 7/20, then the payoff amount would be $36,304 + $7/day accrued interest after 7/20.
447	The amortization schedule is attached.
447	Phillip
448	Greg, I have been working with Bill Montez.
448	I furnished a personal financial statement, EIN number, and we worked through a variety of forms.
448	I am pulling together the partnership agreement and other organizational documents.
448	Let me know what else I need to do.
448	I received the final geotech report yesterday.
448	Let me know what this means.
448	It did not look good to me.
448	Crazy amounts of fill and still nowhere near a PVR of 1". Bobincheck got me all fired up about HUD being out of money yesterday. Darrell calmed me down somewhat, but should we go ahead and submit a package to Bank One just in case? Still need to look at the numbers once again. Email when ready. Talk to you soon. Phillip
449	I did not receive the 2nd quarter trend report by email.
449	My email address is pallen70@hotmail.com.
449	In the future, I would prefer a hard copy and the ability to download from the website.

451	Jeanie, Here is a letter about why Frank should be promoted.
452	Greg here are my questions regarding the cedar park deal.
453	10:30 (Dow Jones) The key to analyzing media stocks is....automobiles?
453	Yes, it's true, suggest SG Cowen media analysts Ed Hatch, Peter Mirsky and Eric Handler, in this week's Media Money Manager.
453	Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting.
453	By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies "to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports."
453	Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp. (NWS), and Disney (DIS).
453	( BS)
454	Jacques, Keith and I were able to resolve our concerns about having the GP as a corporation.
454	Several CPA's assured us that the tax treatment fears we had were not a significant risk.
454	Therefore, we are ready to finalize the agreements.
454	What is the next step?
454	Do we just execute the copies we have?
454	I haven't heard anything else on the stagecoach from Kevin Kolb.
454	I keep leaving messages.

457	Call Barry Tycholiz
458	Griff, Can you please accommodate this request?
458	Phillip
459	Dexter, Hopefully Griff Gray has sent you the information on your id and password by now.
459	It should be good through January.
459	Please email or call if any problems.
459	Phillip
460	Janie, Do you want to work with regulatory to make sure we can comply?
461	Tim, Is something wrong with the database?
461	It appears that the iso load, hour ahead intertie data, and the northwest hydro info has not been updated since 7/25.
461	Is this just a problem on our end?
461	Let me know when you get a chance.
461	Thanks, Phillip
462	I am glad we finally heard from Kevin Kolb.
462	I would like to close the book on the stagecoach.
462	I will be out of the office next Wednesday through Friday.
462	I would like to execute the partnership documents on Monday or Tuesday, if possible.
462	Sorry to hear about your wife's condition.
462	She will be in our prayers.

465	Francis, Here are the files we need in excel.
465	Thank you for your help.
465	Phillip
466	Jean, Congratulations on being team leader for the video.
466	Here are some ideas: 1.
466	A long winded VP drones on and on asking questions about an analyst that is not in his/her group while the camera flashes to other bored VP's.
466	It could start with sighs and rolling eyes then build to comical efforts to be put out of their misery.
466	(gun to head or rope around neck) 2.
466	Include some digs at John Lavorato's quirks like always pulling up his shirt sleeves.
466	Just some ideas to get things started.
466	Obviously, the gas market is slow today.
466	Phillip
467	John, I am going to miss the meeting with Vladi about Z6 and weather hedges.
467	I have been planning to be on vacation on August 1st -August 3rd and we are driving this afternoon before the kids get too cranky.
467	I went over the analysis with Vladi.
467	It still seems that the bias of the weather products towards an above normal winter and the averaging vs event nature of the weather options keep them from being an effective hedge for Z6.
467	See you on Monday.
467	Phillip
468	Tim, Is there a website maintained by the Corp of Engineers or other source that reports real time hourly flows and generation from the major dams?
468	I remember one from several years ago but I can only find daily averages on the west power site.
468	Phillip
469	I received the list of properties you mailed.
469	Thank you very much.
469	I would like to stay updated on the market in Hood River and the surrounding areas in Washington as well.
469	I would be interested in lots as well as homes.
469	In case you don't still have it, my address is 8855 Merlin Ct, Houston, TX 77055.
469	Thank you, Phillip Allen
470	Mark, The planned mountain bike activity is on Beaver Creek Mountain.
470	Do you know what kind of trails are there?
470	There is a break on Saturday after lunch.
470	The trails at Vail sound great.
470	Hunter and I would definitely be up for trying them out.
470	Let's set it up.
470	Let me know if you can book a side trip or if you want me to try.
470	Thanks, Phillip
471	I would like to stay current on listings under $225.
471	As an alternative, I would be interested in finding a lot with city utilities to build a small home(<1500 sf).
471	I am not in a hurry.
471	I would just like to follow the market and hopefully find a great deal if I am patient.
471	Thanks for your help.
471	Phillip Allen
472	Michelle, Please send the revised agreements when you get a chance.
472	I spoke to Mike B. this afternoon and agreed to move the deadline to Friday, August 17, 2001.
472	Phillip
473	Vail sounds good.
473	If we are only going downhill our legs shouldn't be too wiped out after the morning.
473	We will be on rented bikes, but I'm sure we can keep them for the day.
474	Jean, Dave Forster is out of town.
474	Do you think we will be able to shoot, edit, and add music to the video using Dwight's camera?
474	Phillip
475	Jean, Please have Melissa send down the CD or give me a call and I will come get it.
475	Thanks, Phillip
476	Kirk, Andy Lewis, a director on the Central Desk, has agreed to participate as a content SME.
476	I plan on being heavily involved in reviewing the content as well.
476	Phillip
477	Michelle, I have executed the Warranty Deed, First Amendment, and the Escrow Agreement.
477	I am waiting for the agreement that replaces paragraph 7D in the original Escrow Agreement.
477	Once you email me that document, I will execute it and overnight all 4 documents to you.
477	Phillip
478	Greg, Here is the story with Bobinchuck's bonds.
478	They are being placed privately with a fund of investors.
478	The interest is 7.7% with no credit enhancement.
478	I guess Agape is the 501-c-3 nonprofit.
478	That's why he has flexibility with the timing.
478	Philip
479	Richard, Here is the power point presentation.
479	Also, the web address below contains the music we want to use.
479	If you right click on a song and choose Save Target As you can save the songs to a file.
479	I will see you tomorrow morning at 8 AM.
479	You can reach me at 713-853-7041(w) or 713-463-8626(h) Phillip Allen
480	Jeanie, Can you send me a list of performance review that I have not completed?
480	Thanks, Phillip
481	Rick, Here is the table to insert during Oxley's introduction.
481	Maybe you could flash to this screen while he speaks.
481	If you can read my notes, the second Oxley intro has a better audio reference to the skewed distribution.
481	That might be useful.
481	Can you send me an email confirming receipt.
481	Phillip
482	Erik, All of the desk heads are leaving for an offsite this afternoon through this weekend.
482	Monday would be better.
482	I would like to schedule meetings for you with several people on the gas floor.
482	I will have Ina Rangel arrange this for Monday afternoon.

483	Kirk, Berney's last name is spelled AUCOIN.
483	His number is ext.

485	Greg, This spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San Marcos by unit.
485	Next, I want to look at the numbers by bedroom.
485	Let's compare numbers.
485	Here is a list of questions: 1.
485	Unit mixes of all proposed projects.
485	2.
485	Completion date of Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr.
485	(186) 3.
485	Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds?
485	This spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005.
485	San Marcos will have over 6,000 units.
485	If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%.
485	That would not be a disaster.
485	Tomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data.
485	Let me know what you think.
485	Phillip
486	Please add Mike Grigsby to the distribution list.
487	Jacques, Hope all is fine with your wife.
487	I would like to get the Stagecoach release finalized.
487	Kevin Kolb is waiting for our comments on the latest draft he faxed you.
487	If it looks ok to you let's sign it and move on.
487	Phillip
488	I have been riding my bike to work a couple of times each week and lifting with Matt.
488	I thought you came in later.
489	Here is the file of historical midmarkets for Sumas and Malin.
489	Call me if you have any questions.

490	Greg, Please call or email with an update on Bank One and permitting process.

491	Aplusmath.com Creates flashcards and worksheets for +-*/
492	Jeanie, If an employee voluntarily terminates, how long do they have to exercise their options.
492	Hypothetically, of course.
492	Phillip
493	Any word on the release agreement?
493	Have you sent all the comments back to Kevin Kolb?
493	I can't tell if they are the hold-up or if we are.
493	I am going to be in San Marcos next Friday.
493	It would be good if we could have things signed by then so we can exchange funds.
493	Please email with status update.
493	Phillip
494	Have you heard anything from Bank One today?
495	Mike, How did the school board meeting go last night?
495	Phillip
496	Jeff, I got your voice mail about the school board.
496	That is good news.
496	Let me know when the closing is rescheduled.
496	Thanks, Phillip
497	Jeff, I got your voice mail about the school board approval.
497	That's good news.
497	Let me know when the closing is rescheduled.
497	Phillip
498	According to Jacques, the release is with the Kuo's attorney, Kevin Kolb.
498	I just spoke to Kevin.
498	The Kuo's have been away on vacation.
498	He is going to try and get things finalized this week.
498	It sounds like they want to sign and exchange money in person.
498	This Saturday afternoon in Seguin will probably be the most convenient time.
498	I will let you know when I hear more from Kevin Kolb.
498	Phillip
499	Ina, Gracie finally sent the CPE credit information.
499	Thanks for staying on top of it.
499	Is there somewhere online that I can find my YTD wages and taxes withheld.
499	I know it was on the pay stub from last week, but I threw that one away before I realized I needed the info.
499	If I can't find it online, can you get payroll to print out another check stub from 8/31.
499	I need to do some income tax calculations.
499	Thanks, Phillip
500	Jeff, According to Kevin Kolb, he has a meeting with the Kuo's today to give a final blessing to the release.
500	He doesn't foresee any issues.
500	If they are ok with the document, they want to sign and exchange checks in person.
500	I will be in San Marcos this weekend.
500	Saturday at 3 PM in Seguin would work well for me.
500	He is proposing that time to the Kuo's.
500	How does your schedule look?
500	It would be nice to finally put this behind us.
500	Any word on a closing date for Leander?
500	Phillip
501	They cannot meet on Saturday.
501	I will probably meet them in Columbus on Monday or Tuesday.
501	I will let you know when.
501	Phillip
502	That should be ok.
502	I will give you a call on Tuesday morning.
502	A Still no word on the Leander closing?
503	Jacques, I sent you a fax of Kevin Kolb's comments on the release.
503	The payoff on the note would be $36,248 ($36090(principal) + $158 (accrued interest)).
503	This is assuming we wrap this up on Tuesday.
503	Please email to confirm that their changes are ok so I can set up a meeting on Tuesday to reach closure.
503	Phillip
504	Mac, The IRS address for estimated payments is: PO Box 970001; St. Louis, MO 63197-0001 Keith PS: Please confirm receipt of this message.
505	Jacques, Once you make the changes to the release, please fax a copy to Kevin Kolb.
505	I am going to try and meet Pauline Kuo on Tuesday or Wednesday to wrap things up.
505	In addition to the release, I will need the guarantee and a release of lien for the smaller note.
505	I will speak to you on Monday.
505	Hope things are going well with your wife.
505	Phillip
506	That's great.
506	Your guys seem fired up about this program.
506	We need something like this in Houston to boost morale.
506	It makes me miss Portland.
507	Can you send me a schedule of meetings?
507	Is there one today?
507	Phillip
508	Jacques, Did you get a chance to look at the release?
508	Drop me a note when you can.
508	Phillip
509	Thanks.
509	I am waiting to speak to Pauline Kuo to schedule a time and place to meet her this week.
509	Hopefully we can meet Tuesday or Wednesday.
509	I will swing by your office to pick up the documents.
509	Phillip
510	Mike, Can you send me a status update when you get a chance.
510	Thank you, Phillip
511	Can you send me a schedule of meetings.
511	I don't know if we have one today or not.
511	I have a doctors appointment this afternoon so I can't make it today.
511	Phillip
512	In light of this mornings events, most of the trading floor is leaving.
512	So we will have to do the meeting tomorrow.
512	Phillip
513	Jacques, Did you receive the fax from Kevin Kolb with a small change on page 2.
513	It also included the conveyance and assignment document.
513	Does this look ok to you?
513	Is the language "Transfer will occur when first lien holder, Pacific Southwest Bank, approves the assignment" sufficient?
513	Hopefully it is ok.
513	Let me know if it is and I will come by your office to pick up executable copies.
513	Thank you, Phillip
514	John, Do you still want to get together this week?
514	Phillip
515	Jeff, The attorney's are done with the documents.
515	I have a call in with Pauline to schedule a meeting to sign them.
515	Most likely in Columbus.
515	I am waiting to hear from her.
515	Phillip
516	Greg or Darrell: Did you get an official rejection or invitation on the New Braunfels project?
516	Phillip
517	Greg, What was the official word on New Braunfels?
517	Phillip
518	The target audience document looks fine.
518	Phillip
519	Congratulations.
519	Glad to hear you made it.
519	You are in elite company.
520	My guess at your time is 11 hrs 10 minutes.
520	Was I close?
521	Don, Jeff Gosset runs the risk management group.
521	I spoke to him about including a module on how the books work.
521	He liked the concept and is willing to sit down with you to discuss further.
521	His number is X37306.
521	He is expecting a call to set up a meeting.
521	Phillip
522	Can you approve this invoice or show me how to get into this system?
522	Thank you, Phillip
523	John, The spreadsheet below ("Valuation Summary..") calculates the value Enron would realize if we turned back the capacity or released it at full tolls.
523	As of 9/17 mids, the 200,000/d leg would generate $16,918,907 if turned back.
523	There is still a substantial amount of value above variable costs on the books.
523	For 03-06, variable costs are around $0.15 but the mid-market spread is $0.45.
523	The PV volume for that term is 22,000 contracts.
523	Phillip
524	Jacques, If you can believe it I have been unable to get with Pauline Kuo to sign all the agreements.
524	Kevin Kolb sent me additional comments on Monday.
524	I faxed those to you.
524	Can you please make the changes to the "Receipt of Payment".
524	I can change and initial the small change on the settlement agreement or if you email the document I will change it on the computer.
524	It would be easier if you could email me the documents so I can print out originals here.
524	Thank you, Phillip
525	Jeff, In light of the puny VAR allotments attributed to the simulated trading participants, we have decided to graduate Matt Smith from the exercise.
525	Please advise Kimat Singla it will no longer be necessary to calculate a simulated book for Matt Smith.
525	Please use his COB 9/25/01 P&L as his official score for this exercise and post his total on the High Score table under the initials MDS.
525	Thank you, Phillip
526	This is a list of common mistakes.
526	However, as the group works together to create exercises and scenarios for the simulation many additional ideas will be generated.
526	I don't want to hold up this document.
526	I just want everyone to be aware that it is not all inclusive.
526	Phillip
527	Kirk, This document is fine.
528	Kirk, I would modify this document slightly.
528	The first section is titled "Introduction to Risk Management" and the second section is "Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products".
528	However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.
528	I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.
528	Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.
528	Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.
528	The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.
528	You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.
528	Phillip
529	I like these homes much better than the one from earlier this week.
529	I like the steeper pitched roof and the high glass windows in the top of the gables.
529	Plus these seem a little bigger.
529	I like the floor plan of the hoover plan better than the van gendersen.
529	The kitchen should be bigger.
529	You could take some space from the sewing room and add an island to the kitchen.
530	Greg, I forgot to mention the Perrin Oaks ideas.
530	They are on the attached memo.
530	Have a good weekend.
530	Phillip
531	Please email me back with a location for tomorrow's meeting.
531	Phillip
532	Greg, I went to the title company yesterday and as instructed by Irwin I signed the deed of trust, the promissory note for 8.4, and the subordination agreement.
532	Can the loan amount be adjusted based on new costs estimates.
532	What will happen at closing?
532	Is the major problem with the appraisal that since the land was only appraised at 1,120,000 we would be required to contribute an additional 180,000 in equity?
532	If so, that is not good.
532	You mentioned that the we are firm on the construction numbers given to me previously.
532	Can you send those numbers again so I can be positive I am not looking at old numbers.
532	Also, I would really appreciate a schedule of true costs and expected loan.
532	Thank you, Phillip
533	Kirk, What is the deal with this boat trip?
533	Seems too extravagant and wasteful.
533	I am not comfortable with this.
533	Can't we just have a small happy hour once the project is complete?
533	Phillip
534	Gary, Can you call me to discuss the panel quote for the Allen residence issued to Johnnie Brown?
534	In April you worked up a quote for $20,000.
534	The dimensions of the house have not changed.
534	The quote given last week was over $26,000.
534	Have raw materials and labor increased by over 25%?
534	I need help understanding this increase.
534	Phillip Allen
535	Richard, I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's.
535	I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.
535	I already have my blueprints completed.
535	What I took from our conversation was to use the SIP's with 8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. I was wondering about alternatives. Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. But would the foam insulation be as effective? Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money. I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference. Thank you for your help. Phillip Allen
536	Greg, I won't be in the office on Thursday.

538	I will be there tomorrow, but I have a bunch of rehab exercises to do for my knee.
538	I probably won't be much of a partner for a couple more weeks.
539	Yes, I will attend the meeting.
540	Karen, I interviewed Agustin Leon and Zoya Raynes.
540	Here are my comments: Agustin Leon: Has a lot of experience with quantitative and technical analysis.
540	Programming and language skills.
540	If not a trader could be an asset to research group.
540	Zoya Raynes: Has already been through Salomon's rotational program.
540	Her interest lean more towards marketing than trading.
540	Seems very talented.
540	I would recommend both candidates for further consideration.
540	Phillip
541	Tim, Since the three nuclear units have gone down there has been a significant increase in imports into California from the northwest which coincides with increased hydro output.
541	This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.
541	Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.
541	Monday: In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.
541	The elevation is starting to creep lower.
541	Can you help us with these questions?
541	Will this drafting to continue?
541	What is the elevation target for the end of the month?
541	Why did yesterday's inflow decline so much?
541	Thank you, Phillip Allen
542	I am going to be in a meeting with Accenture on Friday from 9am until 3pm.
542	So I can't meet with Paul Margraves.
542	Have him call me directly and I will set something up.
542	Phillip
543	Bob, I do have a survey of the sight at home.
543	I will get you a copy tomorrow.
543	Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of the contracts we need.
543	The website is below.
543	I believe the relevant contracts are form #20-4(One to Four Family Residential Contract) and form #OP-H (Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition).
543	A coworker is about to close on a home without using a broker and these are the forms he used.
543	I Phillip
544	I like the cedar t-111 version better.
544	Why don't you tell this shop teacher not to be to comfortable and that you will be taking his job in two years.
545	Randy, Why is there a PG&E Citygate position in Mgmt-West?
545	Were these positions created in the last week or so?
545	Can you print a forwards detail and move these deals into FT-PGE?
545	Do not just transfer at mid market.
545	Please move the deals.
545	Phillip
546	John, It would be a good idea to pull together the desk heads to air out concerns.
546	We all have questions and don't feel we have all the facts to answer the questions employees are asking.
546	The sooner the better.
546	Phillip
547	Thanks for the update.
548	I will try and find my title policy this evening.
549	Renee, Thank you for the forms.
549	I am trying to estimate my tax obligation.
549	It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income.
549	What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?
549	I thought those were already deducted.
549	Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made.
549	On the contrary, there are losses.
549	Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid?
549	Thanks for you help.
549	Phillip
550	Thanks
551	These are fine.
552	Michelle, Here are my comments: Section 9b- It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002.
552	Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans.
552	I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the "Utility Lines".
552	Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C. Section 10- Please change to Purchaser can extend closing for 3 successive periods of 30 days each for $10,000 per extension, not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable.
552	Also, I would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other.
552	I have sent Mike B. a copy of this email.
552	Thank you, Phillip
553	Adrianne, I cannot download his resume.
553	Please resend.

554	Brent, Please call me so we can do a 15 minute phone interview regarding your interest in the trading track program.

555	Left message and sent email.
555	I will let you know as soon as I have spoken to him.
556	Please send more details regarding this meeting
557	Adrianne, I spoke to Brent D. I would recommend that he is given a chance to interview for the program.
557	Phillip
558	Can we meet from 10am-11am instead?
559	Greg, I would rather sign and fax copies of the necessary contracts then follow up with originals through the mail.
559	Phillip
560	Jacques, I need to pull together the Bishops Corner organization documents so we can close on the bank loan.
560	Did Keith and I take the originals or did we leave them with you?
560	I know we still need to issue the shares for the GP.
560	Please drop me a note.

561	Is this the weekly fundamentals report produced by Tim Heizenrader's group?
561	In Houston, we have been receiving the report on Tuesday afternoon via email before the fundamentals meeting in Portland.
561	How can distribution through or administrative assistants be more efficient?
561	The administrative assistant for the West gas desk is Ina Rangel.
561	Her locaPhillip Allen
562	Bob, I found the warranty deed but I could not find the title policy.
562	I will call the title company that we used to get a copy today.
562	Phillip
563	Andy, I don't know what your need for brokerage services are, but Scott is nice enough as far as brokers go.
563	Personally, I am extremely pleased with the transition to online platforms and find that I can get 90%+ of my business done online.
563	If you have a need for brokers, Scott is a good choice.
563	Phillip
564	Renee, I wrote "check" as the method of distribution on the form I dropped off last Thursday.
564	I thought it would be more likely for the distribution to be made off-cycle.
564	However, if the distribution could be made on-cycle I would prefer direct deposit.
564	Is this email sufficient notice or do I need to do something else?
564	Thank you, Phillip Allen
565	Carlos, I faxed you a copy of the contract to sell the property in Leander.
565	The title company is Chicago Title Company in Austin.
565	Their address is 1501 S Mopac, Suite 130, Austin, TX 78746.
565	Wendy Butters is the contact person.
565	Her number is (512)480-8353.
565	Phillip
566	Jacques, Thanks for pulling together the copies of the organization documents.
566	Have you had a chance to gather the title work?
566	Call or email when you get a chance.
566	Phillip
567	Renee, Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.
567	It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.
567	However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.
567	The plan document under VII.
567	Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock."
567	Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.
567	Thank you, Phillip Allen
568	Richard, I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included.
568	So that reduces some of the savings.
568	Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home.
568	Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate.
568	Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs.
568	I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do.
568	What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?
568	Radiant barrier?
568	More attic ventilation?
568	Thank you for your help.
568	Phillip Allen
569	Jerry, I had a couple of questions about the exchange.
569	1.
569	Can I place the replacement property into a limited partnership?
569	2.
569	The cash to be escrowed is approx.
569	$650K.
569	At money market rates of 3.5% the interest in six months would be over $10K.
569	Will the funds be held in an interest bearing account and will I receive the interest?
569	3.
569	Should I fed ex all these documents to the title company?
569	Thank you, Phillip
570	Bob, Let me know how I can help with the variance application.
570	Phillip
571	Renee, I would like to have a meeting to go over the payment methodology.
571	Scott Neal and Tom Martin would like to attend as well.
571	This afternoon at 2 PM or later would work for us.
571	Please let me know what time we could meet.
571	Thank you, Phillip
572	Greg, I faxed you the promotional on 10300 Heritage Office Building with the Nimitz post office.
572	The broker called back shortly after I spoke to you to let me know that the kestrel air park building and the strip center at fm78 & walzem had both sold.
572	Let me know what you think of this property.
572	Also, let me know of any other ideas about replacement property.
572	Phillip
573	Jim, Take a look at this spreadsheet.
573	I tried to calculate the IRR on the port Aransas and Roma post offices.
573	Is this how your clients usually evaluate these properties?
573	The Roma deal looks much better.
573	Phillip
574	This sounds better than the limitations you were describing in the meeting.
574	We should be able to work with this.
574	Phillip
575	Jim, I received your email on the Killeen post office.
575	I am still having a tough time making the math work.
575	Can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show why the post office is such a good investment?
575	Maybe the assumptions I am making about interest rates, expenses, or value at the end of the lease are incorrect.
575	Phillip
576	Bob, The application for the variance states that I applied for a permit on October 29th and was rejected.
576	Do the discussions with the building inspector constitute denial.
576	Phillip
577	Steve, I need help determining how much margin the short options require.
577	My account has a value of around $1,400,000.
577	That includes 750,000 of us treasury notes.
577	I am ready to build a bond ladder of muni's.
577	I need to know how much I can purchase with the funds in this account.
577	Obviously, I don't want to margin the account to invest in fixed income.
577	Please get back to me soon.
577	Phillip
578	Tim, Have you considered reducing the scope or terminating the Accenture project to conserve cash?
578	Where are we in terms of %complete?
578	Phillip
579	I would like more detail about how much margin my open positions require and how the muni's are treated with regard to margin.
579	The call's I am short are way out of the money.
579	The only positions that are changing very much in value are the Enron shares I am long and the Enron puts I am short.
579	I would consider closing those positions.
579	I would like to put the maximum possible into Muni's.
579	Please forward this email to Steve.
579	Phillip
580	When can we reschedule the meeting regarding phantom stock deferral.
580	Any day except Thursday would work.
580	Phillip Allen
581	I would like to achieve a yield of 5%.
581	I am expecting an average maturity date of 2020.
581	Since the treasury is only paying 6.25% taxable at 39%, isn't the effective yield only 3.8%?
581	Why wouldn't I move this money to muni's?
581	Phillip
582	I am still using my home Nortel VPN access.
583	What are the specifics of those bonds are they insured what are they rated?
583	Can you work up a ladder from 2015-2026?
583	Shouldn't I buy more than just one or two issues?
584	Let's start with $1 million.
585	Bob, I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.
585	The hearing will be on January 8th.
585	In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, the application had to be in by November 9th.
585	I was under the impression that yesterday was the deadline.
585	Sorry if I dropped the ball.
585	On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful suggestions about the addition.
585	It might be possible to move the addition forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.
585	You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new space for your game/play/music room.
585	Then you could close off the existing play room to replace the bedroom lost.
585	Part of the play room that is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for a built in desk with a couple of computers.
585	This way you would not have to add a second staircase.
585	The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.
585	In the back you could slope the roof until you were within the setback.
585	Then you could place a large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.
585	From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition.
585	The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would be more shaded.
585	That is the west side of the house so that might not be a bad thing.
585	Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or dining room would still be possible.
585	Personally, I think opening the dining room would be the better idea.
585	I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exploring anything except your original plan.
585	But I wanted to suggest something in case the variance was not granted.
585	Let me know if you want me to try and sketch out these ideas.
585	Phillip
586	The spreadsheet you sent will not open up and calculate any yields.
586	Can you resend?
587	I will not be in the office on Thursday.
587	Can we meet on Friday at 10 am?
587	Try to get a room off the 32nd floor.
588	Jim, I realize you are excited about these post offices.
588	But I really need help analyzing the numbers.
588	Phillip
589	Please send me an email describing the zero option so I can pass it along to the other SME's.
589	Phillip
590	Jeff, Can you resend the info on the three properties you mailed and the one you faxed on Tuesday.
590	I was out of the office last week.
590	Phillip
591	David, For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.
591	Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.
591	The beginning of Section 6.3 states "Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?".
591	This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.
591	I disagree with your translation of "a single sum distribution" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.
591	I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L. In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.
591	This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.
591	Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.
591	This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.
591	Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.
591	Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.
591	Phillip
592	Mike & Tony, Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.
592	Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.
592	I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.
592	I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.
592	Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.
592	If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.
592	I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.
592	We are torn between two good locations.
592	However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.
592	The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.
592	We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to our plan to move to San Marcos.
592	I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.
592	Phillip Allen
593	Are we scheduled to meet tomorrow at 10 AM?
593	If yes can we change to 2 PM?
593	Phillip
594	The project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with Accenture in which Enron pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form.
594	This allows Accenture to have a completed project and no more cash goes out the door.
594	The effort from the SME's should be complete by Christmas.
594	Please push forward with the review of the knowledge layer.
594	Phillip
595	Jim, Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.
595	Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low.
595	Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith.
595	I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at.
595	Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time.
595	Thank you anyway.
595	Phillip
596	Tony, Here is the completed worksheet.
596	I also attached both a plumbing and an electric worksheet.
596	I spoke to Steve Chapman with the panel company in Kerrville.
596	He has a complete set of plans plus an engineers drawing of the slab.
596	I let him know that you would swing by and pick them up.
596	He said he knew Mike.
596	As I mentioned, Mark Olguin should also have a complete set.
596	I will arrange for the additional copies to be mailed.
596	Call with questions.
596	Phillip
597	As discussed on the phone earlier today, please send 5 full sets plus 5 floor plan only sets of my house plan to Dyal Roberts Custom Homes 260 Thompson Drive Suite 19 Thank you, Phillip Allen
598	Thanks for the invitation.
598	Keith might have the freedom to go.
598	Phillip
599	Phillip Allen Home 713-463-8626 Cell 713-410-4679 Remember to fax a copy of the term sheet to John Butler.
599	(fax: 212-450-4800)
600	This file contains graphs illustrating volumes by tenor by product type on a quarterly basis since Q499.
600	For example, daily volume for Natural Gas Financial Swaps during this quarter has been 25 BCF(25,000 contracts) for 1 month trades, 20 BCF (20,000 contracts) for greater than 1 month trades, and 50 BCF (5,000 contracts) for less than 1 month trades.
600	Please call with questions.
600	Phillip Allen
601	Call or email with additional data requests.
601	Phillip
602	Jay, I need to compile a report that shows transaction volume by basis location(Basis Swaps) and volume by location for Phys Forwards as well as Finc Swaps for Power.
602	We have given them a list of the locations at which we like to make markets.
602	They want to see historical volumes at those location to judge the liquidity at each location.
602	You can reach me at 713-515-3949 or x37041.
602	Thanks for your help.
602	Phillip
603	Heather, This is exactly what we need.
603	Would it possible to add the prior day for each of the dates below to the pivot table.
603	In order to validate the curve shift on the dates below we also need the prior days ending positions.
603	Thank you, Phillip Allen
604	Heather, Did you attach the file to this email?
605	Why is the body shop being closed?
605	Why can't it continued to be operated on a reduced staff with out exercise classes?
606	Jeff, JP Morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual P&L.
606	Gas P&L for 2001 was 1.2 Billion but the theoretical curve shift was -13 million.
606	This is from a file assembled by David Port which is attached.
606	The biggest difference is 9/14 ($500 million).
606	This is probably money coming out of reserves.
606	Besides that day there are many smaller differences.
606	Can you help me by pulling the P&L packets from some of the larger days?
606	The answer might be that the file from RAC is bogus.
606	Phillip
607	Jeff Gosset is going to pull the P&L packet from the days with the biggest discrepancy and we will go from there.
608	Sounds good.
608	This email address goes to my work.
608	If you finish on Friday or over the weekend, please send to pallen70@hotmail.com .
608	Thanks, Phillip Allen
609	If you get the info from the owner this afternoon, please send it to pallen70@hotmail.com.
610	Can you fax me the rent roll?
610	713-646-2391.
610	Also please send the unit mix and square footages again.
610	Thanks, Phillip
611	Greg, I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.
611	The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.
611	But there is not a professional management company.
611	Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.
611	However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.
611	This would yield an NOI of $240,000.
611	Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.
611	The asking price is $2,700,000.
611	Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.
611	Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.
611	The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.
611	The cost per square foot is 36.58.
611	The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.
611	Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.
611	This property has not been on the market.
611	So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.
611	If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.
611	It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.
611	Plus the location is by far the most convenient.
611	Financing is the other consideration.
611	I am assuming 25 year, 7%, and 25% down.
611	What do you think could actually be achieved?
611	Can you put me in contact with a lender?
611	I will follow up with a phone call.
611	Thanks, Phillip
612	Jeff, I reviewed your revised offer sheet.
612	I am OK with the effective income of $484K.
612	Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number.
612	The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.
612	$484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.
612	I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon.
612	He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization.
612	See the attached spreadsheets.
613	Here is lakeside in your format.
613	Looks like 11% cash on cash plus whatever principal is paid on the note.
613	My biggest concern is that actual vacancies and concessions have been higher than in the pro forma used to underwrite the offering.
613	Also expenses were higher.
613	Why would we be able to do any better than the existing management?
613	I would like to come see it again on Wednesday.
613	I would be bringing 1 or 2 others.
613	Could we see it in the morning around 9:30 or 10 am?
613	Phillip
614	Mac, This looks good.
614	I won't know exactly what my cash position is until mid January.
614	I will let you know.
614	Thanks, Keith

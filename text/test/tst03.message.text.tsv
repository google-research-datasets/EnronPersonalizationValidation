0	Shelly, I would like for David and I to handle this process from the Office of the Chair in order to ensure an orderly deployment of needed resources.
0	Please facilitate through Mr. Oxley.

1	Dan, I can't open - please send hard copy.

2	Guys, as part of the new A&A program being rolled out by the ENE Office of the Chair, a new Associate and Analyst PRC is being set up.
2	I have nominated you as the six people from ENA to be on this PRC.
2	You will represent ENA's A&A's and participate in the evaluation and ranking across the entire company.
2	This is a very important function - please represent us well.
2	Regards Delainey
3	Mike, who is working on the Duke restructuring now?
3	Regards Delainey
4	How do we immunize ourselves from the workouts being shed into Raptor?
4	Regards Delainey
5	Gere, just following up on the offsite - have you all agreed on the target producer list for the insurance product?
5	How is the peaker product developing?
5	Regards Delainey
6	That may work - I don't want to end up with an equity position I just worked hard to eliminate.
6	Further, raptor may be a good accounting hedge but if we took back JEDI's share at existing marks we would be destroying significant real value.
6	Will the buy back price of the equity/debt we get back from JEDI incorporate the write downs we think should occur?
6	Regards Delainey
7	David, once you get the demand lets discuss before deployment.
7	Regards Delainey
8	Mike, I will want to see those economics.
8	Thanks Delainey
9	Sounds good - lets see if we can start marketing the product and the capability.
9	Regards Delainey
10	Sounds good - I think you have a great opportunity in this market - I would suggest staffing aggressively in order to take the first mover advantage.
10	I note the associate needs.
10	Regards Delainey
11	Maybe that commercial is closer than to the truth than I thought ......
11	Regards Delainey
12	both
13	Scott, what is our emissions strategy for these counterparties?
13	Regards Delainey
14	Chris, when did BP Amoco get involved?
14	I thought we were dealing with Avista.
14	Regards Delainey
15	Scott, you need to make your own call on that one - I think you could add value in either.
15	Regards Delainey
16	Mike Moulton has been pursuing an idea in the technology area for a while.
16	The sponsorship of this idea clearly fits in Net Works.
16	Could one of youfine gentlemen give his idea a test drive?
16	I would much appreciate if youcould give him a call.
16	Regards Delainey
17	Guys, I understand that none of the facilities were available today - I thought we were targeting 750 MW.
17	What is the updated availability schedule for each unit?
17	We are only a couple of weeks from June 1.
17	Please advise.
17	Regards Delainey
18	Lew, it looks like I have some appointments I can't get out of on the 24th; however, we could be out there by noon on the 25th.
18	How does that fit?
18	I did get a call from Mike letting me know that he would be sending over the CA.
18	Regards Delainey
19	Joe, I would appreciate a quick call by you to Larry to ensure that his organization is focused to get these plants over the goal line ASAP.
19	We still have technical issues with the vendor that need to be addressed.
19	I believe EE&CC is working the issues; however, a phone call from you to emphasize the importance to Enron will add extra encouragement.
19	Thanks.
19	Regards Delainey
20	Guys, have we started the mobilization on the tear-down of the two 501FD's at Gleason?
20	Will they be machining the equipment on site - it appears to me that we should not let that equipment leave the site if possible.
20	Do we have a credible site rep from Westinghouse for both Wheatland and Gleason?
20	Please advise.
20	Thanks Delainey
21	Guys, I appreciate the updates.
21	Please ensure 1) that you, as ENA, are integrated 2) deliver a very clear expectation with EE&CC with a credible plan and 3) that you scream bloody murder if a deliverable is missed.
21	You will need to bird-dog this to closure on an hourly basis to ensure that we get over the goal line.
21	Keep me in the loop daily so that I can keep the pressure on at a senior level.
21	Regards Delainey
22	Rob, does the new contract have the same price or is it an increase?
22	If it is at the same price, I would agree with Barry that this is a very visable display of Enron Canada's participation in the business and social community and it should continue to sponsor the flame.
22	On the accounting front, expense it in Canada - it will be an explainable variance for this year and budgeted next.
22	Let discuss Regards Delainey
23	Thxs Joe -much appreciated.
23	Dave
24	Jere, please forward the list of targets.
24	Let me speak initially with John - lets try and get this done today.
24	I appreciate the effort on the peakers.
24	As well, I would suggest we start discussions with Reeding & Bates which according to both Redmond and Thompson is a live deal.
24	Thanks Delainey
25	Looks rather impressive.
25	Good job.
25	Regards Delainey
26	This looks good Mike - I appreciate the efforts.
26	Regard Delainey
27	Mike, I forwarded your interest to Whalley, McConnel and McMahon.
27	Any technology effort really should be lead by NetWorks.
27	This is consistent wiSkillings strategy and what has been communicated to the analysts.
27	You should receive a call from one of these gentlemen.
27	Regards Delainey
28	Chris, I can assure you that I was not part of the "organization".
28	Got the books - going throough now and I will get back to you.
28	Keep Avista's feet to the fire.
28	speak with you soon.
28	Regards Delainey
29	Jere, I spoke with Scott on these targets and his belief is that both himself, Allen and John have significant relationships with these folks which should help leverage your product into this sector.
29	Scott and John have agreed to set up these meetings with the decision makers in these targets with no delay.
29	From there, you, John and Scott can determine what deal team will go speak to them about the opportunities.
29	I would expect that we will be in front of these folks ASAP.
29	Lets see how the product is embraced by these customers before we extend the target list and create a more formal alignment of the groups.
29	As per your earlier e-mail, I assume you are working on the Reeding & Bates opportunity.
29	Regards Delainey
30	FYI
31	Tammy, please ensure that budgets and cost tracking similar to the peakers/Doyle are set up ASAP for Austin and Vitro.
31	These should be updated and circulated weely.
31	Regards Delainey
32	Rob, Andy Fastow is the only one who has not signed the DASH.
32	He may have a few questions please give him a call.
32	Otherwise, Kay Chapman and/or Mark Frank have the DASH.
32	I have signed.
32	Regards Delainey
33	I am in Florida - I think I am available the night of the 24th for the baseball game.
33	Kay please follow up - I would like to make the game.
33	regards Delainey
34	Larry and Joe, Is there any additional moral pressure that we can put on Westinghouse to get the resources needed to expedite the resolution of the Gleason 501FD issues and the vibration issues at Wheatland?
34	The phone call by Larry to GE has made a world of difference.
34	Regards Delainey
35	FYI
36	Kay, try and schedule me in
37	Bill, can you set up a meeting to discuss credit issues.
37	just you and I is fine.
37	Regards Delainey
38	Guys, Swank has confirmed with me that he is committed to join the mid-market group in east power and make a difference.
38	I would strongly support his movement into either SERC or ECAR as per our earlier discussion.
38	I hope to be moving several experienced dealmakers into the gas and power mid-market groups to increase our deal-making skills and relationships in those markets.
38	I would also hope to move a reasonable number of new associates (that only rotate within trading and mid-market) to the various desks.
38	The goal is to increase the bench strength of the trading and mid-market groups plus support John's iniatives on the fundamental groups.
38	Regards Delainey
39	Tom, you are making the right call - give me a day or two to manage the positions.
39	Regards Delainey
40	Jere, I understand your frustruation and I am very motived to prove out the insurance product; however, I do think John has a legitimate concern (especially given the fact that this group blew up very publically internally and externally and we need to repair the image internally and market perception externally in order to be successful in the future) surrounding multiple groups covering the same customers with different stories.
40	You guys could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John at the offsite): a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination if this is a commercially viable product; b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote this capability to these customers ASAP; c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP; d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups.
40	This appears to be a reasonable and logical approach on an interim basis.
40	Regards Delainey
41	Any ideas?
41	These guys (John & Jere) just can't get it together.
41	Regards Delainey
42	Kevin, I would like more detail on these issues of which I was not aware - lets discuss next week.
42	Regards Delainey
43	I think it would be great if Dan and Kevin could participate.
43	Regards Delainey
44	Janet, I though we signed a turnkey with NEPCO - there should not be any overruns to your P&L if that is the case.
44	Regards Delainey
45	Rob, I think we should renew the flame for the three year period.
45	My understanding is that it is $75 K Cdn per year roughly.
45	Not paid up-front and cancellable if Flames leave Calgary or disappear.
45	Expense in Canada.
45	It is your call ultimately.
45	Regards Delainey
46	Celeste, try and get him scheduled into the Super Saturday if possible so that the risk guys can take a look at him.
46	If that can't be done then give me a call.
46	Regards Delainey
47	Ben, why are we distributing this?
47	It is inaccurate and I'm not sure I want it floating around the place.
47	Regards Delainey
48	Guys, I will set up a monthly meeting between myself and you guys to discuss deal flow, priorities and strategy - I think you will find that more effective and I can keep the other meeting small.
48	Kay, please set up.
48	Regards Delainey
49	John, great job!
49	Please, work with Jeff to move the longer term deal along.
49	Regards Delainey
50	Dick , I appreciate the effort on the Moore project - I would hope that there is more than a $2m saving in the scope.
50	This plant is still showing $460 to $470/Kw given current economics.
50	I am still puzzled by this.
50	Regards Delainey
51	Eric, we need more than $2M saving to get this deal to clear the hurdle.
51	I think we need to get to $350 to $400/kw firm including IDC to make this viable.
51	Please ensure that NEPCO is working to figure out the disconnect.
51	Regards Delainey
52	Rodney, please give Cliff a call.
52	I spoke with him today.
52	He will handle.
52	Please fill him in on your discussions to date.
52	Thanks Delainey
53	This is great Rob!
53	Regards Delainey
54	Good job - Randy.
54	Live to fight another day - I don't know if you know but I settled with Fort James - we ripped up all three contracts for no money that netted us approximately $15M in value through the elimination of the two power contracts in the NW.
54	Wertz was on the other side.
54	Thought you might want to know.
54	Thanks Delainey
55	Eric, I am on the road - I really don't have much to say.
55	We have had very little interaction.
55	Regards Delainey
56	This is great - please update and forward weekly.
56	Regards Delainey
57	Rob,this deal is not dead; I am primarly waiting on NEPCO numbers.
57	You should be moving down the road on the deconstruction, refurbishment and movement of the NB machines.
57	You should also be doing any development work (permits, interconnection agreements et al) you need to do to maintain the optionality of this project (let me know if the expenses get above $1MM).
57	Randy, please facilitate.
57	Mike, can we put the screws to ABB given the significant transformer business we forwarded their way?
57	Laura, we probably need to make a call on the Peoples turbine pretty soon.
57	Eric/Rob, I think we need to see the project with IDC come in between 350 to 400/kw to be viable or I need a very detailed analysis of why it costs significantly more than a Frame 7 machine in the US markets.
57	I would like see us make this work.
57	Regards Delainey
58	Mike, why would it cost $450 to $470/kw for the Moore project?
58	It is a 4 unit ABB configuration and the turbine costs appear to be in line with Wilton 7EA's on a kw basis.
59	kay,please approve in the PEP system.
59	thanks Dave
60	Don, lets hang tough for a day or two.
60	Nothing needed for Cinergy.
60	Regards Delainey
61	Mark, you have this one!
61	Regards Delainey
62	Guys, we are working to put together the final team to manage this issue; however, it isJeff Skilling's call to keep Delainey, Milnthorp and Keohane out of the day to day fray on this issue.
62	I believe this is the right call.
62	Commercial and legal resources from Houston will manage this issue on a go forward basis and may call on you as a resource if needed from time to time.
62	You have done a very great job managing this issue to date and your efforts on that front are much appreciated.
62	Our focus should return to growing the business and meeting our financial targets.
62	Peter, I believe that Mark H. would like you to stay involved through the Friday conference call that is scheduled.
62	Regards Delainey
63	Delainey
64	yes
65	OK
66	Regards Delainey
67	Ben, don't do anything at this point.
67	It is not needed.
67	Regards Delainey
68	please approve in system
69	Don, with regard to your previous message please contact Michael.
69	Regards Delainey
70	What about Barry and Eric?
70	This looks good.
70	regards Delainey
71	Ed, this looks great!!!!
71	Please ensure that the focus is on coverage, deal flow and building markets.
71	I want to avoid two groups hunting strategic elephants (ie) east origination and development so ensure the scope is consistent with mid-market coverage and feeding the desk deals and info.
71	In the case of building or purchasing assets please let Jacoby's group handle.
71	Any deal or lead that significantly disrupts coverage or takes you or your people out of the market please pass or coordinate with origination or development There is bound to be some conflict between the strategic origination groups and you - please keep to a minimum and resolve in a manner consistent with one team and doing the right thing.
71	Please provide John and I a monthly report of customer transactions completed, coverage plans and "market building iniatives".
71	Let me know how I can assist in any way in recruiting or transactions.
71	Regards Delainey
72	Tim, in the east power group and the gas groups, we are trying to build a mid-market capability(deal flow, information and coverage) consistent with the largest energy merchant in N.A..
72	Please see tha attached.
72	I would be curious to talk to you about your structure, coverage functions and market building iniatives.
72	I recognize that you and your group have been the most effective and proactive group in these areas for some time.
72	Is there areas where we could be more aggressive or proactive?
72	Can I get you more resources to cover the market more aggresively?
72	Lets discuss.
72	Regards Delainey
73	Jeff, I would like to discuss this with you and your plans in gas.
73	Regards Delainey
74	Please follow up with this person if interested.
74	Regards Delainey
75	I think Jean is gong to be there - thats ok.
75	Regards Delainey
76	Guys, the project should be charged market based rates and ENA is not in the business of subsidizing international projects.
76	This is particularily the case if we are not going to hold a continued interest in the project.
76	However, if we can not reach a term O&M agreement please maintain the optionality in the project by managing the facility on a direct bill basis to APACHI until they find an alternative provider.
76	Do not in any event abandon any assets at any time.
76	Regards Delainey
77	Where did he rank against other folks at the super saturday?
77	I would argue that if he was in the top 30%, we should accomodate his need.
77	regards
78	Gary, I have not heard much more on this issue - are you ok with this?
78	Regards Delainey
79	Guys, I am getting the impression that we are having quality control issues - it just sounds sloppy?
79	Am I wrong?
79	Do we need more focused resources?
79	Regards Delainey
80	Jeff, what is your current thought process on TXU?
80	Regards Delainey
81	Ray, I am ok with Nick and his group managing if Redmond/Mrha are ok.
81	Like Rebox, whoever is technically responsible is highly accountable to ensure that reporting and procedures are correctly followed and that the project comes in on time, budget and technically works.
81	In this capacity, I would like that engineer to report to you or Wayne Mays.
81	Regards Delainey
82	please handle regards
83	Guys, as a follow up to our mtg - the following deliverables were agreed to: a) CMS/Noxtech deal structure - outsource product - McClellan/Affelt - next week; b) ERC strategy in California - McGowan- couple weeks; c) fundamental analysis completion on California, NE and MW - McGowan - ongoing; d) regulatory support for SO2 and NOX - George to speak to Genelle; Delainey speaks to Shapiro/Kean.
83	Regards Delainey
84	Guys, as a follow up to our meeting - the deliverables include: a) producer team - Jones/Polzin - one live deal/prospect from the producer sector for the insurance product in third quarter; b) power team - Duran/Overdyke - one live deal/prospect from the IPP sector for the insurance product in the third quarter.
84	Thanks Regards Delainey
85	I believe this has been handled appropriately; however, FYI.
85	Regards Delainey
86	rodney, are you managing and coordinating these reference requests for ENA to EES?
86	I think that these requests need to be highly controlled into the EES organization at a high level and screened by you as being necessary or not.
86	Regards Delainey
87	Tim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $11.0M) has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the Industrial groups (McConville and Ondarza).
87	As you are aware, I sued them for breach.
87	The settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft.
87	James and Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.
87	It is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland shop.
87	The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.
87	It seemed logical to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability.
87	Lets discuss.
87	Regards Delainey
88	Guys, I will forward the info as it becomes available.
88	There appears to be one project in Texas and one in California which are well down the development road.
88	If interested in these projects, which have to meet a December 2001 COD in order to get the tax credit, I would suggest that we purchase the development sites and turbines from Enron Wind and keep the asset, commodity position, tax credit and possible green credits in ENA.
88	They are Ok with that strategy.
88	This is an opportuntity that needs to fleshed out fairly quickly - Ben and Dave can you lead this analysis with close contact with Doug and Tim on the desk.
88	We can get together to discuss if you like.
88	Regards Delainey
89	Joe, thanks for the assistance.
89	We have a few items still outstanding on the Doyle (Georgia PPA with Ogelthorpe) unit; however, It looks like we have the '99 and '00 plants completed.
89	The 2001 program is much smaller.
89	I will follow up shortly.
89	Regards Delainey
90	Wes, expense the amortization to Office of the Chairman not West Power or Origination.
90	Regards Delainey
91	Jeff, lets try to get consensus in how the east desk might work and then discuss next steps at that point.
91	thanks Regards Delainey
92	Guys, please attend if available.
92	Regards Delainey
93	that is correct
94	You know what - I agree!!
94	Don't let it go to your head.
94	Dave
95	Rick, in the interest of preserving trees and keeping the information reasonably controlled, I would distribute this to senior managment and the portfolio managers in each origination group responsible for each investment.
95	Portfolio Managers Steve Pruett - Energy Capital Resources - (E&P) Chuck Ward - Generation Investments Chris Helfrick - Industrials and Coal Michael Miller - Principal Investing Richard Lydecker - Restructuring Ray Bowen - CTG Andrea Reed - CTG Wes Colwell - Controller Jordan Mintz - Tax Management Jeff Skilling Joe Sutton Mark Frevert Dave Delainey I don't think we need to distribute this data farther.
95	The business unit heads in the finance origination groups can access their portfolio manager for the data if needed.
95	Regards Delainey
96	Bob, I know that you made this work !!
96	This recovery plan is exceptional.
96	Regards Delainey
97	Rob, makes sense.
97	How does this change our view on Moore?
97	Delainey
98	Guys, please come up with a plan to meet Ben's requirements.
98	The key sites/jobs for 2001/2002 include: - Project Moore (Ontario) - 06/01; -Coyote - early '02; Regards Delainey

105	Guys, we are getting close to completing the quarter, the following gross margin is expected from each of these groups before the end of the week.
105	If there is any issue of any type please give me or Wes a call.
105	If there are any upsides to these numbers please let us know as well.
105	East Origination $1.000 M West Origination $9.086 M (inclusive of all QF fair value) Industrial (incl trading) $12.899 M Generation Invest $45.350 M (including fair value and accretion on ECP) ENA Upstream $41.112 M (including Sithe earnings plus HPL, LRC and upstream origination) Equity Portfolio Current MPR for quarter ($26.786M) (large positions - moves with market) plus an additional writedown of ($279K) equivalent to $27.5 M less ECP and West QF earnings listed above minus $10M.
105	Regards Delainey
106	Guys the PRC has been moved to 11:00.
106	Regards Delainey
107	Greg, it is really up to you - if you have other things to do don't worry about it.
107	Regards Delainey
108	Janet, thanks for the note - I have you down for a firm incremental $3.875 M net to Enron.
108	Regards Delainey
109	Guys, as per our discussion, I am assuming that the upstream group will provide gross margin (not including trading) of $30.7M net of the HPL compressor writedown of $3.0M.
109	Regards Delainey
110	Don, in my opinion options 1 & 2 are the same and 3 is not an option.
110	I would like to provide an outsourcing deal that earns us fees and provides information.
110	We will manage the internal issues.
110	A properly priced and scoped term outsourcing deal should be doable.
110	Please speak with Sally Beck and Beth Perleman.
110	Regards Delainey
111	Nella, sorry to see you go; however, best of luck in all your future endeavours.
111	Regards Delainey
112	Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we managed the position in a very effective manner.
112	Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors on these boards?
112	Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti is putting plan in place.
112	Regards Delainey
113	Guys, your teams did a great job managing a very difficult situation with very few material effects to the organization.
113	It is noticed and appreciated please pass on to your organization if you feel appropriate.
113	Regards Delainey
114	Guys, what is the contingency plan to manage these outages in the event we can't manage this as effectively in future situations?
114	Regards Delainey
115	Ed, sounds like you have this handled - I would like to use your report as the example to use in other groups.
115	It can wait until you have it all completed.
115	You may want to think about EOL as well (ie) how many companies have you brought on-line, etc. summary: - coverage metrics; - completed deals; - hot list; Delainey
116	Jim, I agree - lets put a plan in place to ensure appropriate representation at these ISO's (not unlike PAC) and ensure that FERC is not abdicating their responsibilities.
116	The three of us probably need to get together and discuss tactics around a number of issues.
116	Jim, I am also curious where you are in your thoughts and plans given your new role.
116	Regards Delainey
117	Mary, I'm just curious why you need that info but it is 0 outside Enron comp plans.
117	Regards Delainey
118	Scott, sounds great!!
118	Can't wait for the next one.
118	Regards Delainey
119	Guys, as a follow up to our meeting today, I thought I would put together a list of deliverables agreed to in the meeting.
119	The goal would be to have a definitive strategy for HPL and storage assets by the end of July that could be acted upon.
119	a) Elimination of the Entex contract - current value - John L.; b) Storage value algorithm incorporating spread values, increasing intra-day and monthly volatility and blowdown values - Jean M, John L, Jim S.; c) Storage acquisition targets and issues surrounding value/execution - top 5 to 10 for blowdown and tarantula strategy - Jean M, Julie G.; d) Structure, value, cost and issues surrounding Bammel "header" - Jean M.; e) Project Torque - definitive balance sheet, income statement and contribution margin statement for HPL - Wes C.; f) Establish viability of selling HPL assets - small private placement - working with Lehman to finalize value, exection risk, timing, structure et al I would like this group to get back together in the fourth week of July to determine a final action plan.
119	Regards Delainey
120	Waiting for the number and rationale.
120	I will get back to you shortly.
120	Regards Delainey
121	Steve, please provide me a reasonable offer on the C-Gas asset.
121	Please provide rationale for economics.
121	As per our earlier discussion.
121	Regards Delainey
122	kay please schedule regards
123	Mark, noted - early in the process.
123	regards
124	Mike, I want to see the final costs before determining.
124	My understanding is that there is still significant expenses outstanding.
124	Regards Delainey
125	Eric, this looks good.
125	Regards Delainey
126	Rick , good result in California so far - what is the status of our plan for New England ICAP issues?
126	Regards Delainey
127	Ronnie, this sounds like good news.
127	I think the project team managed the #1 turbine problem heroically.
127	Talk to you soon.
127	Regards Delainey
128	Jeff, have you finalized how Jenn and Craig will split out the industrial segments?
128	They should also come up with their business plans and a reporting matrix similar to what you are doing with the desks.
128	How are you making out at the desk level in implementing our previous discussions with Scott and the remainder of the desks?
128	Regards Delainey
129	Kay, why are we waiting to the end of August!!
129	Regards Delainey
130	I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into this important process.
130	There is nothing more important to ENA than attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.
130	Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers and directors can be delivered.
130	As per our discussion, the PRC process is primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.
130	It provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only determinant.
130	In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following: a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities.
130	Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately; b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure performance issues.
130	For the satisfactory category, the message should focus on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.
130	The bar is always being raised.
130	For the needs improvement category, the message should focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.
130	For the issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better "fit" in the organization or counsel out.
130	Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of action to rectify performance.
130	Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC currently scheduled for July 31st.
130	I anticipate a similar process as above with our officer feedback process.
130	Associate and Analyst rankings can not be communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.
130	Other identified action items from the meetings include: a) the HR group will put together a "profile and performance book" for ENA's A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at the July 19th meeting; b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to continue rotating within ENA; c) ENA will be holding an additional "off-cycle" A&A super-saturday for Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area; and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment candidates for your review each week.
130	Please review these resumes in a timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.
130	Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.
130	Regards Mark and Dave
131	Kay, please forward to Scott Josey, John C Thompson and Julie Murray.
131	I could not find them on e-mail.
131	Regards Delainey
132	Kay, please forward to Max Yzaguirre.
132	The e-mail failed.
132	Regards Delainey
133	Guys, this is the real deal - we need to be ahead of this!!!
133	How are we making out on acquiring brownfield sites and formulating a strategy?
133	Regards Delainey
134	Jeff, what exactly do you want Craig going to be doing?
134	Please forward a job scope for Jen and Craig.
134	Then I will speak with Max if appropriate.
134	I apologize but we have spoken about a lot of different scopes - it would be helpful to start from a scope on a piece of paper that we both agree upon.
134	Just e-mail.
134	Thanks Jeff.
134	Regards Delainey
135	I agree with Jeff - we need to have a more concrete plan and capability.
135	Let me know what you want me to do.
135	Regards Delainey
136	Sounds great!!
136	Regards Delainey
137	Laura, I would like to congratulate you and your group on a very successful quarter.
137	Hats off to the team!!
137	Let me know how I can help.
137	Please forward to your organization as appropriate.
137	Regards Delainey
138	Thanks Mike - great job on the 2000's and the recovery at Doyle.
138	Lets together once the accounting is completed and determine what is appropriate in fee to pay.
138	Regards Delainey
139	Janet, scheduling this is a nightmare - if Ben can't make it you can cover.
139	Thanks Dave
140	Mike, this looks great - looking forward to seeing your final thoughts.
140	Regards Delainey
141	Ray, couple of comments: a) Donahue is responsible for the portfolio management function but also incorporate the idea of Jeff being responsible for ENA's "capital book" (ie) managing existing deals and intimately involved in conjunction with Treasury and the various origination groups of which finance transactions get or don't get on our books; b) Has Fastow clearly put Defner in the ENA Treasurer role?
141	- if so we should also mention this in the note; c) Chuck Ward ( Generation Investments); Don Miller ( Merchant Generation); and d) with regard to commodity structuring ensure it is clear that they will facilitate and structure the highest priority/value transactions across the organization even though they report to Janet (ie) they don't just work on East Origination deals.
141	Let me see the final before release.
141	Make sure Mark is on side.
141	Regards Delainey
142	On the fee, let Mike manage he knows my thoughts.
142	Regards Delainey
143	Guys, any interest?
143	Regards Delainey
144	Guys, we need to figure this out in the next couple weeks.
144	John do you want to take a stab based on manager, director and VP rankings?
144	Regards Delainey
145	Ray, if Mark does not have any other comments - lets go ahead and send the memo out ASAP.
145	Regards Delainey
146	Rick, looks like a good start - as per our discussion, this is a very important issue.
146	Janet, please assist on the UI front if necessary.
146	Regards Delainey
147	Jeff, I don't believe the offer I showed you of $39 M is unreasonable.
147	In fact the team had recommended $42 M based on a number of measures.
147	I see the 6X multiple of annualized Q2 earnings as one of the best measures of the potential value of this company.
147	I don't see it in the best interests of Enron to be transferring assets below a reasonable market value between business units.
147	You can trust that I will be keeping the Energy Capital Resources team's feet to the fire on the realization of this value if you do not purchase the company.
147	If you and Steve can come up with a better indication of value, I will support that transaction.
147	Regards Delainey
148	Steve, please call Jeff and go through in detail how we got to our valuation of approximately $39 M. Please ensure that this is a reasonable facsimile of value that ENA would accreate over the short to medium term assuming your continued management.
148	Let me know where you end up.
148	Regards Delainey
149	George, it is probably worth speaking to them about the US assets - probably the smaller Virginia sites which are probably less core and may be great brownfield sites.
149	I'm not sure we would have an interest in UK coal fired assets.
149	I would speak to Sherriff on that one.
149	However, I would caution that real value is created through RAPID brownfield development leveraging on Enron's development, electricity, coal and emissions talents.
149	For ComEd and Homer City, Mission has already paid up for these assets based on gas being on the margin.
149	Now that was before a lot of the run up so it may be worthwhile; however, I think it may be difficult to arb these guys.
149	As well, I think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them - I'm not sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a Wall Street point of view.
149	We should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core Virginia assets.
149	Are they in QF, if so there may be upside in the deal from Duran's point of view..
149	Dave, given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger part of the load curve, coal assets or coal QF's may be great assets for us from a restructuring and power asset (expansion/brownfield) point of view.
149	Have we looked at this?
149	Are there many in the market?
149	Regards Delainey
150	How could coal fired QF's play into your and George's strategy?
150	Regards Delainey
151	Janet, we have been down the road with these guys before and it was not very pleasant.
151	I think it is hightly unlikely that Larry will be coming up with an additional 7FA turbine - but you can call him.
151	I'm also starting to think as the LM position starts to get better managed that maybe you and Chris should take the D5's and 7EA's onto your book.
151	Something to think about, I am just concerned about your ability to manage more complex deals without some resource availability.
151	I think you have to feel pretty good about the LM position first.
151	Something to think about?
151	Regards Delainey
152	FYI
153	Richard, I think I am starting to obsess and I really don't want you guys working on this; however, it think that it is very odd that this Griffin guy over an eight week process, two registered letters and a phone conversation does not send a letter or bring up this "Chrome Dreams" issue from 1986 with us until this lawsuit is filed without our knowledge.
153	This guys sounds a little off.
153	Regards Delainey
154	Guys, where is Rebox - it seems to have disappeared?
154	I assume you guys are working on the accounting issues necessary to book the swaps on the Garden State deal.
154	Regards Delainey
155	Chris, did we get the DASH completed and approved on Pasotria and LV Cogen?
155	Rob, I have not heard what the plan of action is with Moore?
155	Rob, what would be the necessary steps needed to book all or some of the Bruce deal in Q3?
155	Regards Delainey
156	David, I wouldn't do the Brown Bag (too often- too hard to keep doing); I wouldn't do the Social Gathering (too country clubish); I like the Monthly Dinner/Cocktail Hour/Ballgame, etc with the OTC and parts of the management team as a forum to identify talent, give A&A's exposure to the management team and to "sell" ENA.
156	I would suggest that we make it every two months rather than monthly.
156	However, I would have the first one very quickly for the top rated A&A in ENA that are due to rotate soon in order to try and pitch them on staying in ENA - maybe dinner and ballgame.
156	For the resource management and coaching part of the program, lets wait until we see where we end up on any possible changes to the program first.
156	I assume that you are working on a couple strawmen on possible alternatives.
156	Once we have a few ideas, I would like to pitch Whalley, Sherriff and Mark when I get back.
156	Lets go ahead and implement above ASAP.
156	Regards Delainey
157	Wes, we have the following dates set up: a) East Midstream and QF Restructuring - Aug 15; c) Canada Origination - Aug 16; d) West Midstream - Aug 17; e) HPL, LRC and Upstream Origination - Aug 28.
157	We are setting up the remainder as we speak.
157	I have some final comments on the packages you gave me; however, the color printing will not fax so we need to find time to discuss.
157	Please fax the Friday "package" and the final Q2 numbers.
157	Regards Delainey
158	Jeff, I am not aware of any questions.
158	Regards Delainey
159	Whats's up with these machines - are we paying for past good luck?
159	Regards Delainey
160	Rob, please follow up with Dorie she will handle the process for you.
160	Regards Delainey
161	Rodney, interesting title- is someone giving you grief on this strategy?
161	Regards Delainey
162	Don, couple of points: a) would take a page to describe the Bridgeline structure (ie) we have done this before; b) haven't we done more that 150,000 transactions?
162	c) we are getting paid a fee for providing the back-office services?
162	Let me see what you come up with after discussing with Presto et al.
162	Regards Delainey
163	Good job Rodney - keep me up to speed and let me know where I can help.
163	Regards Delainey
164	Janet, its your book - if you feel we have the LM's licked and we need the resources/the value at risk is minimal, I would go ahead.
164	I would get Calger on side as well.
164	Regards Delainey
165	looks fine to me regards
166	Don, go ahead and set it up - what have been discussing with them on the gas side?
166	Did CSFB tell them about the $400 Kw capital cost plus the three year Tell Beverly or Kay to make time for next week if Mr Forster can make it.
166	Regards Delainey
167	I'm already perfect :)
168	Unless asked just bring your smile.
168	Regards Delainey
169	Jeff, my team believes that there should be a premium to book in the range we quoted to you; however, I appreciate your interest.
169	I would agree that we have spent enough time on this and it is time to move on.
169	Regards Delainey
170	Wes, please have the detailed HPL numbers available to discuss on Monday.
170	Regards Delainey
171	Guys, lets set up a meeting between the three of us on Monday ASAP to discuss.
171	I have a few ideas and I probably need to go have dinner with Lew to get him comfortable.
171	This may be setting up to be a larger asset management transaction.
171	Don can you try and find a time next week with Lew for me to have dinner - get Beverly to schedule the plane to get me in and out that day.
171	If not next week then early the following.
171	I think it will take a one on one with Lew to get this one centered.
171	At our meeting, I would also like a status update on the other iniatives eg) The accounting issues on the generation projects need to be addressed as well.
171	Regards Delainey
172	Jordan, I assume the memo I asked for is in hard copy on my desk.
172	Thanks Delainey
173	I think we have the wrong date and time on this one - the Upstream QBR is August 28th for an afternoon.
173	Regards Delainey
174	FYI
175	Please follow up if appropriate.
175	Regards Delainey
176	Eric, Jim Ajello in the industrial group is the best person.
176	Regards Delainey
177	Laura, I spoke to Tom about his retail proposals, I told him that you would coordinate a meeting between Mark Muller/Lou Pai and himself.
177	I only want Lou going up if Tom is involved.
177	However, Mark Muller is up to go and I have spoken to him with regard to the opportunity today.
177	He is expecting your call.
177	On a related note, I volunteered Wes Colwell (our controller and former Anderson person) to speak to Peoples accounting/ risk people and Anderson auditors on how to manage the issues surrounding marking the hub values inside Peoples.
177	I would appreciate you coordinating that meeting.
177	If Wes goes to Chicago, we want to ensure Leubbers, the Anderson folks and the appropriate Peoples accounting folks are available so Wes can spend the least amount of time on this issue.
177	Jeff, where are we on the PECO/PSEG retail play that you spoke to Mark Muller about a couple weeks back?
177	Mark, I forgot to mention that FPL is interested in potentially investing in the New Power Company - Tony Altman (President of FPL wholesale) would like to discuss.
177	If interested please call him at 561-625-7777.
177	If you don't think you will have any interest let me know and I will call him to let him know.
177	I probably need to get back to him either way shortly.
177	Thanks.
177	Regards Delainey
178	Jim, I would forward to Chris Calger, Janet Dietrich and Jean Mrha.
178	Thanks Delainey
179	Mike, if you Janet or Dave can cut the deal with Izzo go ahead and speak to him.
179	I don't think there is any practical way to enforce any percieved call we have on Izzo so you will have to determine how much Larry really wants the trubine or how he could benefit from striking a different deal.
179	Regards Delainey
180	Rick, I hope you take the time to speak to Rodney Malcolm or Ray Bowen on how your technical and commercial exprience could help move the outsourcing product (in all its forms) forward in the industrial market.
180	Otherwise, your welcome ...
180	Regards Delainey
181	Kay, make sure Mark knows when you are scheduling these QBR's so that he can ensure the package is ready - some of these are coming up next week.
181	Regards Delainey
182	Mark, note the feedback from the AA's, it is imperative that we get a handle on this!
182	Let me know when I can spring our plan on Jeff.
182	Regards Delainey
183	Dawn, right now I am scheduled to be up in Calgary on the 16th of August - lets shoot for that date.
183	Regards Delainey
184	Jennifer, you are very welcome and I look forward to continuing to work with you - all the best.
184	Regards Delainey
185	Brian, great job - I would really like to get this done for third quarter please let me know how I can help.
185	I have heard that you can request a expedited HSR for fairly straight forward deals like this.
185	Wes, I believe that we don't have any issues recognizing the value from this transaction - please confirm.
185	Regards Delainey
186	Rick, we have re-examined the portfolio as a result of our last meeting and have an expected portfolio of $500M (gross) or $408M (net-ENA's share) to be placed into Raptor on September 1.
186	We have a second tranche of $608M (gross) or $396M (net ENA's share) to be placed into Raptor 2 on December 1.
186	Kafus, Ecogas, Brigham, Crown Energy and Merlin CLO Equity Option will not be part of either Raptor 1 or Raptor 2.
186	Please confirm that this is consistent with you view of capacity and timing.
186	Regards Delainey
187	Wes, as per our discussion, I wanted to detail the action items from the analysis: a) the Office of the Chairman will be increasing the visibility of ROCE and cost metrics as a part of the QBR process; - MPR rationalization, Raptor strategy and divestment/clean-up - - LRC optimization, increased performance - Redmond/Mrha; -Sithe restructuring, elimination of the tracking account - Donahue; - Powder and Wind River sales - Redmond/Mrha.
187	c) specific cost reduction iniatives as detailed in your presentation - implement with feedback/measurement process to ensure buy in - Wes Colwell; and d) further analysis on quality of product/service for cost for non-commercial and group expenses - Wes Colwell.
187	Regards Delainey
188	Charlie, looks pretty general - only comment is what is the Product Purchase Agreement entail?
188	Do we want to go into more detail on the nature of the alliance, the target market and the nature of the excusivity (ie) wholesale renewables applications, ENA, major state programs - all of it based upon the Conneticut job working?
188	Regards Delainey
189	Shocker!
190	Edward, you are very welcome and I appreciate all the efforts to ensure the transition works and we get the accounting treatment we want on Garden State.
190	Regards Delainey
191	David, I want to enforce this to nth degree given his understanding of our industrial offering and that fact he mis-represented his reasons for leaving.
191	Regards Delainey
192	please put on schedule
193	Charlie, your call - just a question
194	Kay, please have Jordan forward this in hard copy to your attention.
194	In don't need to be in the e-mail loop.
194	Thanks Delainey
195	Jeff, we are thinking about how to finish the mid-market iniative and I need to know if you want Breslau.
195	I would like him in a singular role and accountability so I need to plan to incorporate him or not depending on if you want him.
195	Regards Delainey
196	Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes: a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination; b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron Mexico; c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in Houston should provide a winning team.
196	I am asking for the three teams to clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer (ASAP).
196	I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.
196	Either way, I am expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for Canada and Mexico; and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to Regards Delainey
197	Fred, I will research our potential needs otherwise I agree with your approach to keep the option open for as long as possible.
197	Regards Delainey
198	Let me know your thoughts after you speak with him.
198	Regards Delainey
199	How do like that .....
199	I like this guy.
200	Larry, my understanding is that ESA has taken four units and that Janet Dietrich in conversations with ESA has made four more available to ESA subject to them getting their deal approved by the board.
200	So I do not believe Enron needs to committ to additional LM units at this time.
200	Regards Delainey
201	I agree 400% - I look forward to your plan.
202	Rob, we may be saying the same thing here - for the EES outsourcing proposition (which is more than just asset management) as being defined by Rodney et al should be managed together by Industrial Origination and ECC.
202	Although, I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process.
202	My view is that we should not and will not recreate the structuring, customer facing and execution requirements in Canada and Mexico required to do these deals.
202	It is an important strategic iniative for ENA to complete a number of these deals.
202	The problem is that a clear target list, joint accountabilities and schedule between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at Columbia Lakes.
202	All other industrial business other than P&P commodity/asset business is the perview of ECC.
202	Ultimately, I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the deal structuring/due diligence queue.
202	The US group can help get these done and can help in the pitch.
202	Regards Delainey
203	thanks Ben - makes sense.
204	Joe, thanks for the message.
204	It has been my experience that people who have had experience in our trading, mid market and structuring groups have a better overall understanding of how Enron (ECT or ENA) looks at value and manages risk.
204	Personally, this is the track I took which included a very solid foundation in accounting, operations, trading, structuring and then ultimately in origination.
204	I hope this helps.
204	Regards Delainey
205	Guys, I would like to schedule a quarterly meeting to review our technical risk as a part of this reporting procedure.
205	Wayne can you set up a meeting for the four of us over the next few weeks.
205	Regards Delainey
206	Janet, get rid of these LM's - too many cooks!
206	Regards Delainey
207	Margaret, what is involved with this Permanent Residency application?
207	How does it change my status as a non-immigrant resident?
207	Regards Delainey
208	Larry, go get 'em.
208	Whatever you can get you can keep and reduce the fee.
208	You could make this easy for both of us.
208	Regards Delainey
209	Rob, I spoke with Paul.
209	Eric didn't rank high enough.
209	Regards Delainey
210	Jeff, you are killing me - we targeted that group specifically to build the risk business in gas and east power in the short run.
210	This was well planned effort.
210	Regards Delainey
211	Janet, any thoughts - do we have excess development staff - this would be a good opportunity for the brave at heart.
211	Regards Delainey
212	Dave, I still believe that the most flexible model that provides high ROCE and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by Enron.
212	I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing sector).
212	The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.
212	It is not a bad model just a different one.
212	Either way, they will be a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall Street.
212	Regards Delainey
213	Guys, this is my first cut on who I would want to be in this group.
213	I think this is an important exercise on a couple different fronts.
213	We need to bring more people "in" which should increase their accountability for ENA results overall, improve communication and teamwork and provide a platform to evaluate future leaders.
213	Trading Origination Country Managers Support Executive Presto Calger Yzaguirre Beck Delainey Arnold Duran Oxley Lavorato Neal Bowen Haedicke Shively Donahue Murray Allen Mrha Martin Redmond I would like to send out a note this week to communicate whatever we come up with in order to have the right folks available on Friday.
213	Look forward to your comments.
213	Regards Delainey
214	Wayne, that would be fine.
214	Regards Delainey
215	Mark, I am in favour.
215	Regards Delainey
216	As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.
216	As part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and decisions which will impact the overall course of our business.
216	Ultimately, this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic direction of ENA.
216	The only structural committment to your time will be a pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).
216	The Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.
216	The meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, staffing and strategic direction.
216	The first meeting will be scheduled on this Friday.
216	Everybody should make a serious committment to attend, to stay for the entire meeting and to be on time.
216	Regards Delainey
217	Mark, this is great - giving the increased exposure/politics in some of these markets it makes a lot of sense.
217	Regards Delainey
218	Kay, can you make sure I am available
219	John, if we invite Scott then I think we have to add Eric Thode(PR/IR); however, everyone would be in!!
219	What do you think?
219	Regards Delainey
220	Guys, my suggestion would be that RAC should manage the overall monitoring responsibility for ENA;however, I assume that Janet and Chris will continue to be responsible for the ENA turbine book.
220	They should be actively managing and monitoring ENA's piece.
220	Regards Delainey
221	Ben, can you spend a little time and give me some feedback on this item.
221	Regards Delainey
222	Janet, it may be in your personal interest to ensure that a number of witnesses are available to ensure the message is delivered and there is not confusion in the future.
222	Regards Delainey
223	Chris, where are we on gas interconnect?
223	I am hearing rumblings of 15 year Kern exposure - don't know if I like that.
223	Regards Delainey
224	Mike, lets discuss just after Wayne and I get together to discuss the technical book or in conjunction.
224	Regards Delainey
225	David, I would change John Thompson and Ed Baughman to strong.
225	Delainey
226	Tim, I thought I would send you a copy of the East Mid-Market QBR to give you a view on what Presto/Baughman are doing.
226	The West historically has been far better than the East in covering the market and generating mid market deals/services.
226	I look forward to our discussion in Portland next week.
226	I would like to get a perspective on organization, market approach, deal flow, resources, products and coverage for the Mid-Market group at that meeting.
226	Regards Delainey
227	Guys, we appreciate your efforts on this project but we will not be needing your services as owners engineer on the Vitro project.
227	I will honor our agreement on the sell down; however, we have sufficient technical talent internally and externally to manage this job.
227	I see very little effort in continuing to waste internal time in ENA and EECC on this discussion.
227	Regards Delainey
228	Chris, that is correct.
228	See you then Regards Delainey
229	Adrian, you are very welcome Regards Delainey
230	Paul, sorry for the delay in responding, I do not have a direct relationship with anyone in Reliant or TXU; however, Jim Ducote and Janet Dietrich may be the best spots in Enron to pursue.
230	Regards Delainey
231	Dick, you need to agree with Max on the scope to be provided by the OE - I expect high quality service for the money we are paying.
231	The deal on Friday is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of service.
231	I expect high quality EE&CC people to be proactively managing cost and exposure and to be there for the whole process - no pulls to other business lines.
231	If Max or Virgo are not happy I am not happy.
231	I make money you make money.
231	Thanks for your cooperation.
231	Regards Delainey
232	Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per your memo to me of August 8, 2000.
232	In all or almost all cases, we have accepted your position.
232	The agreement should look and behave very closely to what you would have signed with the competing utility.
232	In addition, ENA is paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the term to twelve years from ten.
232	I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than a complete re-trade on the original transaction.
232	I hope this is not the case.
232	The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron Wind.
232	In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction with ENA versus TXU.
232	I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.
232	Regards Delainey
233	Rebecca, looks fine to me.
233	Regards Delainey
234	Guys, keep the pressure on these guys; but, I think Adam is in a corner and does not have a lot of flexibility.
234	Regards Delainey
235	Adam, thanks for the response, I guess it is a good thing for Enron that we didn't do this deal with TXU.
235	Nevertheless, I hope that we can find a way through this without significantly impairing value for ENA.
235	The ENA team will work with you on this item;however, I need your committment to try and keep us whole as much as possible.
235	Regards Delainey
236	Tammy, are you getting copies of all these reports for the book?
236	Regards Delainey
237	Rebecca, I am fine with this; however, Lavorato has was spelled wrong.
237	Regards Delainey
238	Ben, any thoughts?
239	Scott, great job - looking for more.
239	Regards Delainey
240	Kay, please book 9:00 am to 2:00 pm with me Mike Miller & Don Miller with Mike Childers (Entergy) (actually 10 am to 1pm not including travel time to their shop in the Woodlands) on September 5, 2000.
240	Regards Delainey
241	thanks Ray Delainey
242	Guys, it is my understanding that the incremental $5 MM in gas V@R, under an interim authority, expires today.
242	Given current market conditions, I would request an extension of that interim limit - $45MM in total gas V@R for an additional two weeks starting today.
242	Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional permanent increases for gas and power V@R particularily given the Alberta PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the winter season.
242	I will take your lead on this one.
242	Regards Delainey
243	Barry, we currently have six folks coming who all golf: - Barry - Delainey - Ozzie - Milly I would say we should golf everday.
243	I will get Kay to forward travel schedules to you so that we can set up times where everyone can play as much as possible.
243	My understanding is that we are all staying at the Mirage.
243	Regards Delainey
244	Hey, you guys are copying my model!
244	Congrats Regards Delainey
245	Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this is a venture we should support.
245	In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.
245	These units are fully mobile via the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current SCR technology.
245	They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable.
245	The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.
245	The benefits include: a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, Capstone and Elektryon; b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer applications; c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.
245	If ENA through this venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk; d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology did not work or the market did not materialize; e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology; and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.
245	However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the technology proves out.
245	Given, that we could benefit most from the successful application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.
245	Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.
245	We have a very solid history with this company.
245	They have successfully solved many of the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently operating at New Albany.
245	They would bring the technical and engineering expertise at cost for their 50%.
245	ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause at a fixed number for their 50% .
245	If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I will set up a meeting.
245	Regards Delainey
246	Chuck, I appreciate the note - I just like to ensure that everyone is aware of the various issues and that we are managing our risk appropriately.
246	I have a great deal of confidence that you have this handled.
246	Regards Delainey
247	I don't think we can accomodate that request.
247	:) Regards Delainey
248	Kevin, shouldn't we participate in this RFP?
248	Regards Delainey
249	Mark, go ahead and set up the meeting.
249	Delainey
250	Rick, it looks like the number is approximately down $198MM.
250	What is the drill?
250	Regards Delainey
251	Attorney-Client Protected Kevin, If we respond to the RFP with what we believe to be market prices and values and they don't accept it - does that not support a case where damages from the MOPA , for that 500 MW, can be defined to be equal to or lower than our submission.
251	Regards Delainey
252	Patience my friend - before a meaningful change can occur in the A/A program some of the changes in the EI groups need to be resolved.
252	That process is underway - I envision taking a comprehensive solution to Jeff towards the end of this quarter with Charlene on side.
252	I will discuss with you when I have more details.
252	Regards Delainey
253	Guys, ENA will take responsibility for the two 7EA's.
253	We do not currently have any projects for the Westinghouse 501D5A's.
253	However, I do not know what Bowen's view might be for EIM or Haug's for CALME.
253	Regards Delainey
254	Kay, can you set up a one hour to half an hour with each if possible.
254	Regards Delainey
255	Janelle, I was hoping that maybe we could find a half hour to discuss your thoughts on your current role.
255	I have heard you are considering global fuels and Lagrasta's business.
255	I would like to give you my perspective on the future vision for power and the overall organization including gas Ultimately, ENA and Enron have a very open labour market and you need to manage your career in a manner that you feel will benefit Enron and yourself the greatest; however, I think the power market, even though not easy, is the primary growth engine for Enron Corp over the next several years.
255	Kay, can you please set up a time at Janelle's convenience.
255	Regards Delainey
256	David , if this is going to cause you political flack with Mary Joyce lets just kill it - we have revised the original plan and this is probably not needed.
256	Regards Delainey
257	Carol, I believe Hunter is leading the charge on building the gas fundamentals group.
257	Regards Delainey
258	David, how are we making out with this item?
258	Regards Delainey
259	Jen, I would be pleased to attend - sorry for the delay on the e-mail.
259	Kay, please set up.
259	Regards Delainey
260	Tammy, are you getting all these reports?
260	Regards Delainey
261	Tom , I appreciate the e-mail - sorry for the delay in response.
261	I am on-side with all your points.
261	On the New Albany retrofit, I want to ensure that I am not replacing one patent problem with another so a clear "title" up front on the new equipment will be important.
261	However, I will be interested in hearing your solution especially if it can further reduce NOX and increase our operating hours.
261	I share your interest in the FT-4 project hopefully we can take that to the next level.
261	Please stay in contact.
261	Regards Delainey
262	Jennifer, is there another time?
262	Regards Delainey
263	Guys, gas with a $5.00 handle is not a good thing for this deal - I know we are pushing this restructuring as fast as we can; however, I think we need to determine how to move this faster.
263	Any ideas?
263	Regards Delainey
264	Successfully, missed another bullet !!!
264	I have meetings set up with Mariel(the lady you like) and Dan Castingnola, who are the two highest ranked performers in CALME, to see if they are interested in joining our team.
264	Regards Delainey
265	Guys, pending the sale of the Wilton Centre unit, I would suggest that we not execute the gas balancing arrangement.
265	The parties should continue to operate and invoice based on the verbal agreement; however, lets not execute the agreement or put it in the data room.
265	We should represent to potential buyers that we have an interconnect agreement with Northern Border and have been accessing supply out of the Chicago spot market.
265	All other gas supply/transport/balancing agreements for the other facilities (including the Northern Border interconnection and the ComEd reg cap deal) will be conveyed to the new buyers through the sale of the LLC.
265	Regards Delainey
266	Good note - don't think I could do better in style or timing!
266	Regards Delainey
267	Kay, please find room
268	Mike, this appears to be a very reasonable settlement - proceed on this basis.
268	I assume this keeps my number in and around the $600 to $615MM for the 2000's all in. Regards Delainey
269	FYI Lets discuss Regards Delainey
270	Don, NewPort Generation has called me interested in the plants.
270	Regards Delainey
271	pls set up
272	Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating.
272	In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.
272	I am a strong believer in that what is measured and rewarded gets done.
272	As well, the middle market capability is crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and that you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market groups.
272	Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.
272	Upon agreement on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.
272	Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the East.
272	Regards Delainey
273	Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will better reflect my thinking around this investment.
273	The current text suggests that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in the fund.
273	I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.
273	I would suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following: It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is important for the following reasons: a) provides an additional "Friend of Enron" to facilitate short to medium term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured commodity and capital transactions in the wholesale group; b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.
273	ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.
273	Regards Delainey
274	David, on a go forwards basis, please ensure that there is a technical sign off on the principal investments DASH.
274	I would like either Bob Virgo or Wayne Mays to have a look at these investments from a technical due diligence point of view and to be on side before the investment is made.
274	Regards Delainey
275	Jim, agree with you - why don't you set up some time for us to speak and go through the Regulatory report and iniatives.
275	Regards Delainey
276	Randall, I appreciate the invite - I would like to continue to be involved.
276	It was a pleasure to meet you and your team.
276	The several things on my radar screen with Bridgeline include: a) improving the financial performance of the entity; b) ensuring that the risk management and trading capability and structure matches ENA's technology, structure, systems, accountability and policies in every manner.
276	In my view, this is not a negotiable item and will only benefit Bridgeline on a go forward basis; c) continue to move from the "heavy lifting" approach to becoming the "smartest pipe" that can harness improved returns by capitalizing on your people, your information advantage and I believe somewhat of a first mover advantage given the continued consolidation of the intrastate competitors (ie) Entergy/Koch/FPL.
276	We will be very supportive of innovative and aggressive positions that are well thought out and downsides defined; and d) increasing the underlying liquidity of our capital position in Bridgeline.
276	My time and resources are at your disposal.
276	Regards Delainey
277	FYI
278	Guys, HR should be in touch with you with regard to a couple of people that I have agreed to take from CALME: Donahue - Maria Elena Garcia - Director; Duran - Boris Feschiev - Manager; Regards Delainey
279	Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward under the structure we have discussed.
279	FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that vest based upon 60MW of orders; - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on that call; - the transaction is fully press released immediately.
279	CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW; - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in FCEL.
279	I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory filings.
279	I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.
279	Thanks Delainey
280	Guys, as usual the investment is subject to RAC review and a DASH.
280	Regards Delainey
281	Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential interest in Bridgeline and he found that Kelly and Cartwright had no real knowledge of the potential deal.
281	Likely this originates at the local level and is probably a long put.
281	Kelly was going to get back to Scott with more detail over the next week.
281	Regards Delainey
282	Kevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology.
282	Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower than 90 degrees at site.
282	Likely the buyer will run any spread option value or multiple value based on 90 degree output.
282	I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.
282	Given that the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really get.
282	Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.
282	The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital cost of the facilities.
282	As well, given current accounting language, any fee we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing.
282	My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and adjust tactics with EECC as necessary.
282	Regards Delainey
283	Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and Doyle 7B burners.
283	This could possibly have two benefits: a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues they are having with GE and b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission correlating into increased operating hours.
283	I need two things to determine if we want to move forward: a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?
283	I believe the timing on this is rather short.
283	Please get back to me at your earliest convenience.
283	I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.
283	Regards Delainey
284	Christi, I was unable to open the file can you please send a hard copy.
284	Regards Delainey
285	Ike, with the danger of being too presumptious, I thought I would follow up with an e-mail to suggest a procedure for trading settlement offers on Wednesday.
285	Attached I have a suggested template for each party to use so that we can ensure that we are comparing "apples to apples".
285	I would also suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers.
285	It may also be helpful for TVA and EPMI to use an independent party, such as Charles Bone, as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties settlement offer.
285	I am in the office over the next several days.
285	Lets discuss at your earliest convenience.
285	Regards Dave Delainey
286	Kay, can you set up a dinner with Randall.
286	Thanks
287	Joe, part of this deal is repayment of the sub debt at par and a series of cashflows that we would probably like to monetize.
287	Have you looked at this?
287	Jeff, I would like to get your view on the economics - basically they are giving us 89% of our carry value in cash and 11% of our carry value in a contingent payment payable at restructuring or sale of their partnership.
287	Lets discuss ASAP.
287	Regards Delainey
288	Ok - you got the ball.
288	Regards Delainey
289	Jim, I have forwarded your binder to David Oxley to set up a meeting for the wholesale group to discuss appropriate homes for your people.
289	It has taken a little longer than expected to get people together but we are making progress.
289	It may be helpful for you to identify, like Abe, where these folks would like to go if they had their druthers.
289	It may be worthwhile for us to have a quick phone call to discuss.
289	Regards Delainey
290	Krista , you are very welcome - best of luck in the future.
290	Regards Delainey
291	Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position in some detail.
291	In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA could create significant value from a project that we have very little invested.
291	I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone and we have no intention of lifting their offer.
291	As far as EECC involvement, as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.
291	I will argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant dollars or taking significant risks.
291	Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.
291	Regards Delainey
292	Chris, as per our discussion, I just want to confirm that we have the ability to break the contract with the EPC provider at any time.
292	Further, I want to confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process (ie putting a number on a term sheet) has been based on trying to maximize the short run value of the project.
292	In other works, we have no intention of lifting their offer.
292	Finally, we are not ordering HRSG's or steam turbines.
292	These guys add no value and they are killing me!
292	Regards Delainey
293	Thanks
294	Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.
294	I think it works welll in allocating resources between competing "going concerns" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new businesses that may not have the income to fund the best talent.
294	I also wonder if the cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.
294	In its own often clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly effectively.
294	Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of time on this.
294	Regards Delainey
295	ok with me
296	John, I think you may want to be part of this.
296	Regards Delainey
297	John, completely agree with your view - David, I would have the matrix, with all of the ENA statistics and names, ready for distribution on Friday to the key managers to try and illicit a response from the low participation folks.
297	Regards Delainey
298	David, i agree in principle with this process.
298	I assume that you and your team will implement.
298	Like we spoke about, I do not see a need to widely distribute this through the commercial organization.
298	I would just implement.
298	Regards Delainey
299	Chris, this sounds good.
299	It would be helpful for us (the overall power business) to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort.
299	I think we all believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and rewarded.
299	Key metrics may include: a)coverage metrics against target customers (ie) customer contact ;b) forward deal flow or hot list; c)completed transactions and origination; and d) EOL customer sign-ons and deal flow.
299	I look forward to sitting down to discuss.
299	Regards Delainey
300	Bruce, obviously ENA does not have a problem with this.
300	Regards Delainey
301	Guys, how are the business units doing on the "talent pipeline" since we have put this on auto-pilot?
301	Is HR still providing resumes?
301	Regards Delainey
302	Guys, can you give me an update on what this deal is about - e-mail would be fine?
302	Regards Delainey
303	Ike, it is unfortunate we could not make this work yesterday; but I understand your position.
303	In the interest of facilitating continuing dialogue and perhaps giving you our view on how we analyze such positions, I will send you our document.
303	I would suggest that we try to set up a follow up meeting in early October once you have completed your work.
303	Regards Dave Delainey
304	Jeff, I think we should take a quick review of the existing PI portfolio to see where we are and where we want to go - we have with the completion of FCEL made a tremedous amount of investment in a very short period of time >$60 to $80M.
304	I would like to hear how we are moving to monetize more mature investments and influence/generate value from the earlier stage investments.
304	I don't want to approve any further investments until we have had such a discussion.
304	Regards Delainey
305	David, I have a problem with the RAC comments made on page #2 of the DASH.
305	Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the reader (ie) what is your opinion?
305	Is this a good sale or can significant recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and infuse more equity?
305	Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given the possible recovery of this sector?
305	The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy prices.
305	Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions?
305	Independent of the desire to move on - what is the right call - I do not want to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring.
305	Regards Delainey
306	Guys, what are we going to do with this contract and the barges?
306	My understanding is that we have a done deal on the 6B's.
306	Is this correct?
306	I may be a nervous nellie but I would like to put all this stuff behind us (ie) no more 6B's or barges.
306	Regards Delainey
307	David, you may be getting to the nub here.
307	Ultimately, this is a lot more art than science.
307	It will be difficult to come up with a mathematic decision rule to manage this process.
307	I am looking to the opinions of yourself, Ray, Dick and Jeff, given the facts in each case, does this appear to be a good trade given the market, the specifics of the company, the carrying costs of the asset and perhaps our desire to increase capital flow to higher return This is clearly not a fire sale and I trust the opinion or consensus that comes from this group.
307	As a result, I need to have a positve consensus from this group in each case.
307	Regards Delainey
308	Rick, I disagree - the DASH had an implication unsubstantiated that the current deal on the table is a bad one.
308	I believe that RAC should provide a clear opinion or say directly that the analysis is deficient.
308	It is too easy to state the obvious.
308	Regards Delainey
309	Jim, I am not sure that this will attract the people we want to hear the message; however, I will hold back judgement until we discuss the strategy in more detail.
309	Regards Delainey
310	Guys, assuming that we receive $7M for the 6B's what is our cost basis in the Barges?
310	Regards Delainey
311	Jim, this sounds like an ambush.....
311	:)
312	Mary, none outside of Enron plans.
312	Regards Delainey
313	Jeff, this fella gave me a call on a new technology that converts chemical feedstocks into industrial gases.
313	He wants to establish the technology in Baytown and is looking for our assistance and capital.
313	This is probably a stretch but it may be worthwhile for you to speak with him.
313	I am not advocating this play just passing on the message.
313	Steve Paras 718-630-5611 He will be in Houston on Friday.
313	Regards Delainey
314	Marion, the leads include Heather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan in the Eastern Origination Group and Michael L Miller in the Principal Investing Group.
314	Regards Delainey
315	Joe, where is the arb?
315	Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play given the owners.
315	Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the customer?
315	Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility?
315	Operational risk?
315	Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated structure in the RFP?
315	Is this a play that you would support?
315	On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?
315	It is important for us to be able to quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons.
315	How is it going otherwise?
315	Regards Delainey
316	Rob, no hi or goodbye - you are losing your Canadian politeness :) On a serious note, you are doing the right thing for the company and for Barry's career.
316	This will be a good opportuntity for him to get to the next level if he makes it happen.
316	As you are aware, I will aggressively support you and the Toronto iniative.
316	Let me know.
316	Regards Delainey
317	Guys, can you forward your parts.
317	Regards Delainey
318	Charlene, that will be fine...
318	on a different note, where are you on the straw man we spoke about.
318	Ultimately, I would like to continue to push this with the leadership team.
318	Regards Delainey
319	Charlene, the 2nd is ok.
319	Either Mark, myself or John should probably be able to do the 28th as well.
319	Obviously, we strongly believe in the benefit of the program and its goals - ultimately, we have to walk the talk!
319	Regards Delainey
320	Sounds reasonable.
321	Erin, don't want to keep passing the ball;however, this is a retail opportunity in almost all states (ie) railroad demand is classified as retail customers under most IOU tariffs.
321	I would ask Harold Buchanan Regards Delainey
322	Oz, David is interested in the fuel cell business, do you need his skill set?
322	Regards Delainey
323	Chris, you are officially the king today!
323	With the PSCo deal this effectively eliminates the LM position assuming we successfully sell LV.
323	Regards Delainey
324	Joe, EnronOnline is essentially the internet distribution channel for our gas and power business.
324	Rather, my focus on the legacy channel is an attempt to increase the probability that more originators can complete transactions and generate deal flow.
324	As well, to reduce the conflict between the trading and origination organizations in order to keep us spending more time in the market than focused on internal issues.
324	As far as specifics, you will have to wait and see.
324	Thanks Delainey
325	Kevin, how do we get at the transmission without buying the entire company?
325	Regards Delainey
326	I am not a big fan of this idea even though it is rather interesting.
326	I just think that the logistics are difficult particularily with employees with families.
326	The drive to Galveston and back - the overnight babysitter - the potential trouble that may result in close quarters and hours of drinking et al.
326	I prefer the original idea at Enron Field.
326	Regards Delainey
327	Guys, it will be very difficult to get money out of the power group - is the expectation that I come up with the dollars - just curious.
327	Are we not circumventing the spirit of the political contribution rules?
327	Regards Delainey
328	Rick which meeting are you refering to?
328	Regards Delainey
329	Jeff, can you speak briefly with Kevin on this one - intriguing idea if the execution was probable.
329	By the way, what is our plan with Sithe?
329	Regards Delainey
330	Ike, given our schedules, it appears that e-mail may be the most effective communication tool.
330	I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our settlement process.
330	As well, I understand that there has been a number of communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.
330	I have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the larger dialogue.
330	The Enron team has told me that TVA wishes to move to firm pricing and a MOU on this technology.
330	Given the larger dialogue, I have suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are going.
330	Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.
330	Regards Dave Delainey
331	Ike, is the president and CEO of TVA.
331	FYI Regards Delainey
332	Rick, I have been having discussions with both Joe Deffner and Jean Mrha on this one.
332	Clearly, this is a commercial banking product in which we have little competitive advantage unless we take more risk on terminal value or collateral (reserve risk).
332	Ultimately, I have challenged the Upstream Group to define the other parts of the deal that would compensate for this increased risk and the cost of capital uncompetitiveness.
332	Regards Delainey
333	Janet, he can approve but can't sign as a director.
333	You need to continue to manage.
333	This would take a board resolution to change (ie) he can not bind the company as a director.
333	Regards Delainey
334	Eric, like the United Way, our goal should be 100%participation.
334	In order to reach that goal, we need the reporting mechanisms to determine which groups and managers have very low participation rates.
334	I strongly believe that ENA's numbers would be better if we had north of 80% participation (ie) the "unhappy" folks are more likely to input info than the "happy" folks.
334	Regards Delainey
335	sure, just set up with kay
336	Guys, attached you will find a list of key transactions identified in the Hot List for each business unit.
336	The performance of your group is key to making our targets for Q4 and to meet budgeted origination performance for the year.
336	Independent of specific budgets for the groups, the origination organization needs to generate $250M for Q4.
336	Ultimately, a strong performance in Q4 by the origination organization will help build momentum into the year-end PRC.
336	I will be setting up time with each of you to go through your numbers and specifics on the deals.
336	Regards Delainey
337	Janet, I completely disagree with legals position.
337	I have difficulty with some of our VP's having signing authority.
337	I believe this is a significant control issue.
337	Mark, is this widespread in ENA?
337	Regards Delainey
338	Chris, do you have a deal book -explaining the overall transaction, returns and risk?
338	This will help me facilitate the process.
338	Regards Delainey
339	Janet, I'm not picking on you - I just can't believe legal and corporate let this go through.
339	Sorry.
339	By the way, Redmond will take responsibility for the Pan Nat arbitration as per our discussion.
339	Regards Delainey
340	Dick, you are doing the right things - if you run into timing issues in the future do not hesitate to give me a call directly.
340	Regards Delainey
341	Guys, please mark your calendars for the 2000 ENA Management Offsite scheduled for December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas.
341	We envision people flying in the afternoon/evening of December 13th with the offsite being held on December 14th and 15th.
341	Departure would occur the morning of December 16th.
341	It is important that everyone stays for the entire period including Friday night.
341	Jeff Skilling and Greg Whalley have taken time out their schedule to speak to us on Thursday and Friday night about Enron Corps strategy and our eCommerce/Networks strategy respectively.
341	A complete agenda will follow shortly.
341	Dorie Hitchcock will manage all the logistics.
341	Regards Delainey
342	Please mark on your calendars to attend given current discussions about the gas organization.
342	Regards Delainey
343	FYI
344	David, do we need to "volunteer" people to participate?
344	Do we want a more structured process?
344	Regards Delainey
345	Janet, what is the status of this turbine - would we be able to turn it back in exchange for foregoing on the ld's?
345	Or do we want this turbine?
345	Regards Delainey
346	Guys, we have the following un-allocated turbines (approximately $100M in nominal value): a) 2 power barges - Brian - $13M All other turbines appear to be allocated to high probability projects.
346	Could you please provide me your plan with these units.
346	I would like to flatten out our book (ie) ensure there are good homes for or divest of all our existing turbines before we look at purchasing additional units for 2002.
346	Regards Delainey
347	Tim, it is all yours please communicate ASAP to Jana Jovanni in the A&A program.
347	Regards Delainey
348	Tim, please provide Jana with your choice of person ASAP.
348	Regards Delainey
349	John, I don't get it - are they trading gas and power.
349	I thought this wasyour group?
349	Regards Delainey
350	Dick, I have signed the DASH.
350	Good job.
350	One comment, the DASH for Basic particularily the RAC comments was very poorly written.
350	Please keep an eye on this for me.
350	Regards Delainey
351	Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.
351	This has been sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter or so.
351	Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to closure.
351	Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some value for Enron to take this deal including: c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the large industrial customers; and d) provides an "in" to the GE family of companies which could result in significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.
351	Regards Delainey
352	Jana, I had a late request from the Portland team to nominate a person, I don't think that Janet would mind letting them nominate this person.
352	If I am incorrect Janet let me know.
352	Regards Delainey
353	Brian, what is the cost basis in these turbines?
353	Regards Delainey
354	Marty, no agenda on this one at all.
354	Given, the change in Enron Industrial Markets towards building the paper and steel commodity markets and less so on the outsourcing product, I just wanted your opinion on whether this is a deal we should do especially given the sales cycle is largely completed.
354	I believe that Rodney and his team want to finish this deal but given other priorities they would like to transition the deal to EES.
354	Ultimately, the value (TCV, earnings, up-sell, resume) would benefit Enron more in EES than Regards Delainey
355	Rodney, from what you told me it sounds like GE is willing to play on the Selkirk asset so the sales cycle should be largely completed.
355	Can you answer Marty's other questions?
355	Regards Delainey
356	Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern Gas Pipeline Route.
356	Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of this proposal.
356	To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward characteristics.
356	Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA point of view.
356	The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project.
356	The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M.
356	the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, venture capital and the "organizing group" (40%!!).
356	Stan Horton, if he believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.
356	Regards Delainey
357	Guys, what is your plan?
357	Regards Delainey
358	Ike, thanks for the letter on Friday.
358	The team is preparing an analysis on where we have flexibility and preparing a response.
358	We should be able to respond before the end of the week.
358	Thanks Dave Delainey
359	Eric, as per my discussion with Rob, I believe that the site has the most value to us given its location and capability.
359	I would continue to actively develop that site for a variety of turbine technologies.
359	As far as the turbines, I would probably exit them in the most opportune manner.
359	Regards Delainey
360	Guys, Joe Sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your capabilities better than ours.
360	In a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by Mass. General Hospital in Boston, part of the Healthcare Partners system, is desiring a steam and electric contract.
360	The steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 MW of power.
360	I think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that HP controls in the nation.
360	The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747.
360	I spoke to him yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.
360	Joe is a big fan of Enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.
360	It may be a good lead into the health care segment.
360	Regards Delainey
361	Guys, attached you will find the final plan to meet our origination targets for Q4 consistent with our discussions.
361	It is important that we hit our numbers in order for Enron to meet its targets for the year.
361	Regards Delainey
362	Rodney, if this deal is such a long put why did you push me into this process?
362	You should have made the call to kill it.
362	Regards Delainey
363	Chris, I would let this fish go.
363	He has been through the organization too many times.
363	Regards Delainey
364	Barbara, short of me coming up with the money, it will be next to impossible to get this out of either the trading or origination group.
364	As a significant contributor to the PAC and Enron's other adventures, I don't have the room.
364	Personally, I also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely linked to specific legislation or policy.
364	This may not be the answer you want; however, I am all ears if you have any ideas on raising these funds.
364	Regards Delainey
365	Guys, notes from the morning meeting.
365	Please review and comment.
365	Specific action items: a) i)further calculation of ENA/Non- ENA capacity charges, ii) estimation of outside legal and iii) formulation of charge out/feedback process to the business units; b) need budget/review for competitive analysis, technical and restructuring.
365	Regards Delainey
366	Jim, hold off until I let you know to go.
366	Thanks
367	Guys, reference to a) below has to do with the legal budget.
367	Sorry for the lack of clarity.
367	Regards Delainey
368	Strike One!
368	Regards Delainey
369	fine
370	Guys, if you or any of you people have interest in attending please contact Wendy Roy.
370	Regards Delainey
371	Guys, anything you can do to encourage your employees to take a little time to participate in the survey would be much appreciated.
371	This is a valuable exercise for the company.
371	Regards Delainey
372	David, can you point D'Arcy in the right direction in ENA or ESA.
372	Regards Delainey
373	Mark, I am not completely sure what the other groups want to do; however, assuming a fixed amount of the "internal" legal costs are fairly represented by this allocation as ENA's "capacity" charge, you are correct.
373	This number will be in the P/L under your name.
373	The "outside" legal costs should be tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit (by deal) level.
373	I need an estimate of the quarterly "capacity charge" for ENA and an estimate of outside legal costs by business unit.
373	Regards Delainey
374	Jim, lets get together in the next week or so to discuss progress.
374	In the meantime, what are we doing with regard to FERC 637 to ensure that we have favourable rules in the trading of natural gas transportation capacity?
374	Do we have a master summary of the RTO proposals submitted last week?
374	Regards Delainey
375	Barry, I have not spoken to Whitt yet - working on this week.
375	I would suggest that you will need to get a few bright managers/associates to manage the mid-market and a couple of more experienced originators (internal or external?) to complement.
375	I would start thinking about how to get that done.
375	I would call Oxley for help if needed.
375	Regards Delainey
376	Jim, I would start focusing some attention on gas at this point.
376	When we get together I would like to sit down and go through a number of organizational re-alignments and what we may want to do on the regulatory front to support those businesses.
376	Regards Delainey
377	Guys, I spoke with Mark this morning.
377	He is very supportive of the structure and idea.
377	I had indicated that he would continue to run the producer services business in the West but would also be part of the overall team as we plot out strategy in the West.
377	He wants to stay in Denver which I think we should be able to accomodate as long as his group stays integrated into the overall team.
377	I had indicated that we would consolidate market making into Houston and Paul Lucci could decide if he wants to continue trading or not - if so he needs to move to Houston.
377	Phillip/Barry, go ahead and start working with Mark as you develop your plans going forward.
377	I will be speaking to Stephanie Miller this week and will give the green light with her shortly.
377	Regards Delainey
378	sounds like a great idea
379	Tim, don't worry about me - it worked out fine.
379	Just a bad day on the P/L side.
379	Thanks for leading some of these efforts it is often a thankless job.
379	Regards Delainey
380	Tim, that will be fine.
380	This is a discussion topic that I want your input on for next year.
380	Regards Delainey
381	Guys, attached you will find the updated orig plan for Q4.
381	Trading income is slim pickings so far .....
381	we need some key deals of all sizes to close in the fourth quarter from your organizations.
381	Thanks Delainey
382	Roger that - book 'em Dano.
382	Regards Delainey
383	Colleen, thanks for the update - as another part of the nat gas value chain, traded transportation, with and without EOL should be a priority.
383	However, I think we have to ensure that we have rules and procedures accepted by the FERC that will allow the market to work.
383	Jim, can you ensure that Colleen and Julie have the regulatory support needed to ensure that the market gets set up appropriately.
383	Thanks.
383	Regards Delainey
384	D'Arcy, sorry I missed you last week.
384	I am going to be down in Rio mid November for some meetings with the S American team.
384	Maybe we can have a discussion then?
384	I would very much like to get your opinion.
384	Regards Delainey
385	Looks good.
385	Regards Delainey
386	Jim, what ever you think is appropriate.
386	As far as the weekend, lets just play it by ear.
386	At the meetings, I think it would be helpful to go through the following a) review the Brazilian and Argentine gas and power markets - flows, grid, participants (bids and offers), assets, pool structures, regulatory and political environment, currency and credit challenges, supply and demand & historical prices and volumes; b) review ESA's current regulated/un-regulated assets and generation strategy; c) review ESA current book positions, market views, products and product development; and d) brief review of other S. American markets.
386	I assume that you will have the Argentines to Brazil for the discussion and any one else you think appropriate.
386	Let me know what I need to do otherwise.
386	Thanks Regards Delainey
387	David, thanks for the people listing.
387	Wes, we need 1999 and 2000 (including CE) ESA income statements for each market in as much detail as possible.
387	Looking for un-necessary overheads and where the income brightspots lie.
387	We would probably need the ESA 2001 budget (income, expense, cashflow and capital) for the trading/marketing/EES business and the asset/regulated business in seperate formats.
387	A current balance sheet would be helpful as well.
387	I think it may be appropriate for both of you to join us.
387	You need to get your Visa issues worked out quickly - Kay can help.
387	Regards Delainey
388	Fran, can you speak to Brian on this issue.
388	Regards Delainey
389	sound good mark
390	pls, forward these to Tammy Sheppherd to incorporate in the ENA OOC reports.
390	Regards Delainey
391	Guys, updates to numbers given discussions at QBR's.
391	Regards Delainey
392	Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.
392	As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be discussed.
392	It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas.
392	This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.
392	In particular, we would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.
392	ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.
392	Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.
392	Regards Dave and John
393	Chris, e-mail didn't pick up your name.
393	You are invited as well.
393	Regards Delainey
394	Please plan on attending and presenting.
394	Regards Delainey
395	Jeff, as per our discussion, this would be a great opportunity for you to spend some time with and instill your vision for Enron to the leaders of the ENA organization.
395	I have attached a preliminary agenda which has you speaking to the group right after dinner the night of December 14th.
395	You have no time constraint on the length of your talk (ie) whatever you find find appropriate in order to get your message across.
395	I though it might be interesting for you to give your vision of Enron's 2001 goals, objectives and strategy.
395	As well, a brief business overview of EES, EBS and Networks may be valuable in building connections.
395	Regards Delainey
396	Gregg, please send a hard copy - the pdf file can not be opened on ENA systems in Houston.
396	Thanks Delainey
397	Steve, great letter and arguement, I think the more public we can be on this one the better.
397	Thanks Dave
398	Guys, can you help Phillip out with this, I assume this has something to do with the 20/20 deal.
398	I believe a reserve should have been set up for this payment which was only designed to ensure that the transaction was accretive to NBPL.
398	Regards Delainey
399	Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull....
399	in the company we would be a $100 stock.
399	On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager promotion for the typical associate including timeline.
399	This process mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.
399	I think radical change is not the answer.
399	The answer lies in a combination of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the program internally.
399	Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.
399	The goals of any restructuring are: a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the program; b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained; c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling and interviewing; d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly grounds the associate in the "Enron technology" which include skills in market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk; e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues; f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, retention and performance tool; g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, non-traditional sources of talent and h) increase cost effectiveness.
399	The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, people and teams, business tracks, etc. I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.
399	I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with a strawman.
399	Let me know your thoughts.
399	Regards Delainey
400	John, this is a Skilling issue - Charlene and myself are going to talk to him about several changes in the next couple of weeks.
400	Regards Delainey
401	Rob, lets discuss.
401	Regards Delainey
402	Chris, Rob Milnthorp will give you a call to further discuss the opportunity.
402	I would suggest that you find a day over the next couple weeks to meet Rob in Calgary to speak in detail about the role, the market and expectations.
402	I appreciate your openess and let me know how I can help.
402	The Ontario market is one of the best new market opportunities for ENA over the next year.
402	Regards Delainey
403	Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that we are reaching these goals.
403	Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.
403	David, Joe and Mark should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we watch the funds flow issues.
403	Regards Delainey
404	Chris, the numbers are getting pretty large - we are trying to find a reasonable cut-off before this turns into an All-Employee meeting at the Hyatt.
404	John and I decided to cut it off based upon who will be wearing large visable budgets.
404	In the West, that includes Tim/Mike for trading; Chris/Greg for mid market and yourself for origination.
404	I hope this rationale will manage your issues.
404	If we invite Jake I think you do have to invite Parquet and McDonald and we just don't have the room.
404	Lets discuss.
404	Regards Delainey
405	Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.
405	At the risk of being bold, I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.
405	Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.
405	With the back and mid office, the current Enron model is based upon scale and standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.
405	Further, it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.
405	In the long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.
405	Don't quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish some of these goals as well.
405	In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.
405	Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.
405	Regards Delainey
406	Great job guys - keep it coming!
406	Regards Delainey
407	Great job - we all appreciate your management of the situation.
407	The A&A program is our most important asset.
407	Regards Delainey
408	Jane, we would like to go the Adjustment of Status route.
408	Regards Delainey
409	I stand corrected - we need to DASH everything over $500K.
409	Regards Delainey
410	Mark, fyi and between you and I. Rob will always do the right thing - he is just a little more passionate than the average Enron guy.
410	Keep trying to build those bridges.
410	Regards Delainey
411	Chris, fyi
412	Guys, great job - the Canadian office is still the model.
412	Regards Delainey
413	Kay, can you handle this stuff for me.
413	thxs Regards Delainey
414	Dorie, as per our discussion.
414	For the Friday night speaker, can you give me an idea of price and availability for the following: - Joe Gibbs - Joe Paterno The topic would be leadership and motivation.
414	Regards Delainey
415	Christi, please provide me with a timeline of when you expect to be filing protests against each utility.
415	As well, please ensure that both Kevin and I sign off on the filing before it goes out.
415	Regards
416	Guys, I would like you to consider the following people to provide the basis of your producer marketing team.
416	They are being re-deployed out of the upstream services group and have significant experience and relationships in the producer services market segment.
416	They can provide mid-market coverage, producer outsourcing, well-head purchases, etc. As per our previous discussion, these folks will be your producer team and will provide all ENA's products to the segment.
416	Please keep this confidential - but please speak with Jean Mrha.
416	The names include: Linda Roberts - director - lead the central region; Mary Jo Johnson - manager - central region (wait until post HPL sale); Jill Zivley - director - lead the east region; Gary Bryan - director - east region; Jennifer Martinez - manager - east region; Bill Brogan - manager - east region; Kreg Hall - analyst - east region; Brian Riley - director - east region (wait until post HPL sale).
416	Both Brian and Mary Jo are inside HPL and if sold would interview with the buyer first and then would be available for ENA - lets wait on these folks until post sale.
416	Lets make a strong effort to accomodate these folks given their experience and availability.
416	Regards Delainey
417	Brian, good memo.
417	Regards Delainey
418	Ike, sorry for the delay, it took us longer to deal with certain issues than expected.
418	I have faxed you a proposal.
418	Lets discuss at your earliest convenience.
418	Regards Dave Delainey
419	Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.
419	Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are appropriate to hit the net ENA target.
419	In order to stay flat year on year, I split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.
419	As we had discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the accountability managed by each of you.
419	All outside variable costs, specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc. I look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks.
419	Wes, can you please finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for each group with these changes.
419	Regards Delainey
420	Dan, any help would be appreciated - we are very well positioned in the Florida market at this point.
420	Regards Delainey
421	Tim, lets not worry about margin at this point - we are trying to get a handle on headcount and direct expenses/capital charge first.
421	You will have your day in court to discuss margin soon.
421	Regards Delainey
422	Mike, duly noted; however, there will be at this point no change in the scope and function of Redmond's group.
422	Thanks Delainey
423	Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.
423	Could you please explain.
423	Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.
423	Regards Delainey
424	David, I don't know if you are the right person to speak with; however, I am looking for detail to explain the substantial increase in insurance related cost allocations to ENA for 2001.
424	We have been given allocation projections that increase our expense from $3.9M to $8.0M.
424	I would like to know how this was determined and the nature of these costs (ie) what assets/positions.
424	If you are not the right person, I apologize for the intrusion and could you please pass this on to the right spot.
424	Regards Dave Delainey
425	Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.
425	We have been able to keep ENA's direct group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well.
425	Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal?
425	Regards Delainey
426	kay, see when this is and if I can go?
426	Regards Delainey
427	Keep pushing these guys.
427	Regards Delainey
428	Ken, I think we should pass on the sponsorship of this event.
428	If you have a different view, lets discuss at your earliest convenience.
428	Thanks Delainey
429	Jim, is there executive summaries for the following: a) Eastern Interconnect investigation by region; and b) RTO's filings.
429	Regards Delainey
430	Jim, can you send me hard copies - I am having trouble opening these reports.
430	Any summaries on the RTO filings?
430	Regards Delainey
431	Janet, any ideas?
431	Regards Delainey
432	Guys, I would like to schedule a one hour meeting to discuss the 2000 and 2001 IT budget.
432	Essentially, I would like this first meeting to discuss our approach to a) understanding in some detail our 2000 costs and the nature/behaviour of those costs and b) in this context, ENA's priorities and the system plan, come up with the 2001 budget and how the accountability will be managed.
432	Kay, can you please try to organize ASAP.
432	Regards Delainey
433	Wes, can you adjust West Power numbers for the drop in headcount.
433	Regards Delainey
434	Wes, Dave Duran agreed to reduce his plan to flat year on year for commercial expenses - can you reflect that in your sheets please.
434	Regards Delainey
435	Paul, thanks for the note.
435	Please clarify the following for me: break out 2001 property premiums ($3M) for each major ENA asset ie) peaker, the ponderosa facility, LV Cogen and HPL/Hanover assets et al.
435	Wes, can you confirm for me that no insurance costs are embedded in the teams 2001 plans.
435	Regards Delainey
436	Mike, can you keep the approval amount under $20M?
436	Regards Delainey
437	You guys need to manage this.......
438	Janet, please have someone draft up a short speech for this function.
438	Regards Delainey
439	Chris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call regardless of the hit.
439	Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be worthwhile.
439	Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you are doing the right thing.
439	Regards Delainey
440	thanks Susan Regards Delainey
441	Rob, we are planning to file the following protest of HQ's behaviour in the NE power markets through their market based rates case with the FERC, do you have any issues with this approach?
441	Regards Delainey
442	Christy, can we send these documents in word format - I'm not sure if this is a problem for everyone but I can never open these attachments from Braeswell.
442	Can you please send a hard copy.
442	Regards Delainey
443	Guys, in coordination with your trading partners, can you start putting together your offsite presentations.
443	Each group will have approximately one hour to one hour and half.
443	A suggested format would include (for East Power, East Gas, West Power, Canada (power and gas), Central Gas and West Gas): a) market overview - including supply/demand, structural changes, etc; b) strategy and opportunities in 2001(include five new trading/origination opportunities for 2001); c) expected 2001 new products/structures, coverage and deal flow; d) what worked in 2000 what didn't; and e) organization and resources - people, assets, constraints, etc. In a nutshell, we want you to share with the group how your market works, where the opportunties lie and how are you positioning yourself to take advantage of those opportunties in order to reach your financial and other goals in 2001.
443	Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock will coordinate and do a lot of the heavy lifting; however, they need your first cut by December 8th.
443	Thanks Delainey
444	Milly is ok; however, I would like a quick read of the document once you send a hard copy up...
444	Regards Delainey
445	Beth, can you start putting together your presentation for the offsite.
445	You have approximately one hour.
445	Topic should focus on the 2001 ENA systems plan (ie) what are identified priorities, key maintenance, new iniatives and maybe your view of where we need to go in the future.
445	I would leave some time for questions.
445	The audience should come away from the meeting with a pretty good understanding of what is our systems agenda for ENA in 2001.
445	Could you have a first cut by December 8th?
445	Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock can do some of the heavy lifting.
445	Regards Delainey
446	working it
447	Guys, can you start working on your presentations for the offsite.
447	Dave I would like you to focus on the new generation of capital products that you are working on for the IPP market which should be able to source short and medium term commodity liquidity and be syndicatable(?) on the capital side.
447	Go into some detail and speak to a couple of specific opportunities.
447	It may also be interesting for you to give an initial cut on the economics of coal generation (including emissions control) given current power and gas markets and a quick view of the development process.
447	How should we participate in this market?
447	Gasification technology?
447	Jeff, in your talk, can you focus on the emerging distributed generation sector ie) the technologies, the users, the VC's, etc. Specifically, how will these technologies change our business model and the overall power business model?
447	How are we positioning ourselves in this market?
447	What is the PI strategy with this regard?
447	Dorie Hitchcock and Tammy Sheppard can do a lot of the heavy lifting; however, we need a first cut by December 8th.
447	Thanks Delainey
448	Joe, has Jeff Rubin confirmed his availability on December 14th from 4:00 to 5:30PM to give us a macro-economic overview ?
448	Regards Delainey
449	Rick, I need your view on which of these deals need to go through the board: - Tex Mex (ERCOT to Mexico transmission line with term PPA with Desarco) - CRRA/Fuel Cell Energy (fuel cell deal with Conn. regulators) - sale of Pastoria and LV Cogen (assume not) - sale of ECP (assume not) - sale of HPL (assume not).
449	Regards Delainey
450	FYI
451	Shawn, just a little buried - why don't you come by on Monday.
451	Kay please schedule.
451	Regards Delainey
452	Steve, what is the status?
452	Regards Delainey
453	Tim, sorry for the delay - lets talk if you think it is warranted.
453	I can see a lot of positives to take this path.
453	However, there are a) pr issues and b) we have hoards of on-going litigation that cost us a bundle.
453	We should make this decision very carefully.
453	Regards Delainey
454	Jim, my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken.
454	I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.
454	I'm not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond what was outlined in the original memo.
454	However, I am in agreement that this needs to get resolved ASAP unfortunately Frevert and Skilling and most of the first world is out this week.
454	I ask for your patience.
454	Lets discuss.
454	Regards Delainey
455	Mark, FYI - In my estimation this business is no bigger than Mexico or the Toronto business ie) $25 to $30M in real value with reasonably high risk.
455	I see no value in having two different agendas being pushed in S. America.
455	I also believe that we could cut overhead and right size the organization and not loose any capability.
455	Early estimations are a reduction in budgeted OH by at least a third to one-half.
455	Did you or Jeff speak with Jim?
455	Regards Delainey
456	Ken, in response to the letter from Mr Miguel San Juan, my suggestion would be to offer up the Falcon for their use; however, given the tight time frame and your recent visit with Mr. Fox that it would be difficult for either you or me to participate.
456	I spoke to Max and he agrees with this approach.
456	I hope this meets with your approval.
456	Regards Delainey
457	Guys, Wes is going to come talk to you about booking more value in Mariner in order to meet Global Finance and ENA targets.
457	I want a view from you guys of what is the prudent carry value for Mariner assuming current gas prices and the reserve increases assumed to coming.
457	Keep in mind what would be a reasonble sale value for the asset mid-next year as per our plan.
457	Regards Delainey
458	Dave, I am going to send Shawn your way - he has extensive development, asset and project finance experience.
458	I would like him under your supervision to manage our coal power development strategy - like we discussed it could be a very robust strategy with multiple exit points.
458	I strongly believe that coal needs to come back into the stack and that the existing development teams (Parquet & Jacoby) are already buried under mid-stream gas development opportunities.
458	This would incorporate acquisitions, development, technology, asset sales, emissions credits & technology, fuel supply and power sales.
458	Please update your 2001 budget to incorporate this new iniative.
458	Regards Delainey
459	Jeff, can you spend a little time thinking about the current North American energy markets (very high energy prices, stretched infrastructure, etc) and determine which game changing or altering technologies, business models or existing corporate positions that will benefit from such price and volatility levels.
459	In particular, I think that Miller should take a look at coal gasification technologies, emissions technologies and DSM/efficiency technologies and how these investments may fit in the charter or our overall business.
459	As well, from a corporate development point of view which parts of the value chain ie) IPP, E&P, utility, assets, etc are undervalued given current commodity curves and expectations.
459	Can you get back to me with a few ideas in the next week or so - maybe it would help to go pick a few brains in various ENA orgs as part of your process.
459	Regards Delainey
460	Sorry Mike wrong address
461	Guys, lets get together to get final resolution to these issues including the peaker fee asap.
461	Regards Delainey
462	Jean, can you give me an update on Q4 from an earnings point of view ie) deals and value.
462	Regards Delainey
463	Rob, can you give me a view on where you stand for fourth quarter from an orig point of view ie) deals and value.
463	Regards Delainey
464	Guys can you give me a view on Q4 earnings ie) deals and value.
464	Regards Delainey
465	Ken, in response to your note, I am not aware of any official dialogue with Mr. Kase Lawal about a potential sale of Mariner or with the economics of the aborted IPO.
465	His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months ago.
465	However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are expected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention significant increases in gas and oil prices.
465	Our current valuations, in the $600M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve growth and current energy prices.
465	Our current goal, is to be able to demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a significant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.
465	The concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a very poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable strategy to maximize the exit value).
465	I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points: a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and b) his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.
465	Otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to sell tha asset.
465	I hope this meets with your approval.
465	Regards Delainey
466	Guys, there is quite a number of us dealing with this problem - what are our solutions?
466	Could we have a corporate jet available for folks stuck in the A&A PRC?
466	Other?
466	Regards Delainey
467	Shawn, if you are in - I would like you to work with Dave Duran on this item.
467	He currently manages the ENA IPP group and the QF Restructuring Group.
467	I would like to manage this under Dave and your leadership.
467	He has created a lot of businesses and value in ENA over the years and can help.
467	Let me know Regards Delainey
468	Rob can you give Om a call.
468	Regards Delainey
469	Shawn, go ahead and give Dave a call to discuss strategy, resources and approach.
469	Regards Delainey
470	Lou, are there concerns that I am not aware?
470	From an economic point of view, it is clearly not in our interest to aggregate residential or small customers who have retail choice; however, standard office service (like the UI deal) is clearly a customized, wholesale/all -requirements sale of significant size negotiated with the utility and the puc.
470	Regards Delainey
471	Rob, thanks for the update - I am assuming that you will come up with $23M Cdn ($16M USD) - "highly likely" with PML.
471	We do not have recorded in the financial statements the $8M Cdn in done deals - you may want to look into that.
471	We need the money to show up given every other Enron group is flaking - bail me out my friend!
471	Regards Delainey
472	Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not dropping the ball.
472	I have a good understanding of the retail product offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority shareholders.
472	I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.
472	I already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business initially.
472	As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff.
472	Regards Delainey
473	Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.
473	Over the years, it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers.
473	The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is questionable.
473	I vote to kill it.
473	Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with my partners.
473	Regards Delainey
474	FYI
475	Rebecca, if you wouldn't mind I would like to sit in on the Monday meeting.
475	I think that Mariella from what I have seen and heard is very capable.
475	I strongly believe that we need to put a dedicated (with fresh eyes) SWAT team on this one that has control of the complete commercial, technical and financial aspects of this project.
475	This is the only way to be effective.
475	Whether it is with you or me or both, I am indifferent I would like to ensure that Kishkill, Wiggs, Gonzales and Alberquerque are not buried in this project given other goals and objectives.
475	Thanks Regards Delainey
476	Pretty quiet on the EcoGas/Kafus front......
476	whats up?
476	Regards Delainey
477	Mark, I really don't think we need to have this all hands mtg - in particular I don't want to drag Lou into this discussion again.
477	Regards Delainey
478	Guys, we need your final review on next years budget (direct expense) for MW Gas (Luce) and LT Gas Fundamentals/Transport Capacity (Gomez) done today.
478	We are running out of time to finalize the budgeting process.
478	I would much appreciate your assistance.
478	Regards Delainey
479	Steve, I appreciate the offer - I hope you didn't have to promise your first born since I was basically giving you a hard time.
479	I may take you up on this next season.
479	Regardless, I appreciate all the good work you and your team are doing.
479	Regards Delainey
480	Guys, can you come explain some of this to me including where we stand on the GE issues.
480	Regards Delainey
481	Don, give Harry some $$'s Regards Delainey
482	As per our discussion.
483	Guys, FYI - Ben, can you follow up with this person with our interest or lack thereof whichever is applicable.
483	Regards Delainey
484	You caught us ....
485	good job - keep them coming!
485	Regards Delainey
486	Guys, please take a read of the draft memo - would like to send out tommorrow.
486	Regards Delainey
487	Updated draft memo.
487	Regards Delainey
488	Jeff, hopefully we can convince you to come when we re-schedule - seemed like an easy call.
488	Regards Delainey
489	Guys, what is this!!!!
489	No - I think that Ahlstrom should take this risk or it should be reflected in a price reduction.
489	I vote not to do the deal otherwise.
489	Regards Delainey
490	Joe, do you have a home for this guy - he desperately wants to stay in S. America.
490	Regards Delainey
491	Joe, couple of points - a) please check spelling and typos closely and b) in the first paragraph of the second page starting "The Commercial Origination...."
491	should end with ".... knowledge necessary to reach our goals."
491	Regards Delainey
492	Dave
493	Guys, I assume that you will have a complete headcount and a revised 2001expense/revenue/capital budget available in the next week or so.
493	I wouldalso like to know what your HR plan might be given these changes.
493	David Oxley will the help with the HR issues and Wes Colwell with the budget issues.
493	No turning back gentlemen.
493	I look forward to great success in the next yeaFrevert, Whalley, Lavo and myself are sitting down to discuss Electrobolt oTuesday morning - subject to that meeting we have approval to go ahead fromSkilling.
493	Regards Delainey
494	Are you in?
494	Time is a wasting.....
494	Regards Delainey
495	Kay, please set up a time for us to speak -- Bruce sorry for the delay - life has been a little hectic.
495	Don't ever hesitate to call, just have patience.
495	Regards Delainey
496	guys, phone numbers: Home: 713-592-9723 Cell: 713-907-6315 Regards Delainey
497	Mike, I will try and call you on Monday - I spoke to Kish about Arcor - he is working on it.
497	Hang in there ....
497	Regards Delainey
498	Brett, can you give me the particulars on the four MEH turbines (ie) scheduled delivery, price, fuel options, heat rate, output,etc - including Regards Delainey
499	Brett, got it covered.
499	thanks Dave
500	Guys, I suggest that we write it down in order to ensure that we don't get it back as other groups use up the Raptor capacity.
500	We have sufficient market data points to do this.
500	Please advise.
500	Regards Delainey
501	FYI - action is required.
501	Regards Delainey
502	ok if Mark is ok.
502	Regards Delainey
503	Mike, sorry for the delay.....
503	lots going on including low value add in board meetings and PRC's.
503	Lets set up this discussion with the following points: a) we are not exiting Argentina; b) we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business opportunity; c) if possible on the commercial front, I would like to consolidate intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater productivity, increased team work, a flatter org chart, real time decision making and greater communication; d) we need to continue to maintain a strong presence (including customer coverage) in both markets including an office in Argentina; and e) I would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for ESA to Sao Paulo.
503	Ultimately, I would like a very flat, commercially focused trading and origination organization (given limited resources) that prioritizes resources based on the highest value transactions independent of geography, retail vs wholesale or development vs commodity.
503	However, I want to keep a strong presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural issues.
503	I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that you guys will find the balance.
503	There is no need for you to leave Argentina - its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business model we are trying to move forward.
503	Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.
503	Please work with Joe and Orlando as part of this process.
503	Regards Delainey
504	Guys, here are the details on the ESA MEH turbines - please forward to me your project details, economics and strategy ASAP.
504	We will allocate these turbines to the project with the best strategic/economic rationale once confirming that they are worth more in ENA versus ESA.
504	If you need more detailed information on these turbines please let me know.
504	Rob, please give me call on this one.
504	Regards Delainey
505	Ben, please discuss with Dave Duran - he will be responsible for our coal generation strategy.
505	Regards Delainey
506	Stuart, only New Albany and Doyle would be left.
506	As you have indicated, Doyle is 100% committed to Ogelthorpe.
506	Regards Delainey
507	FYI see attached Regards Delainey
508	David, good to hear from you - I am sure we will cross paths in your career with Enron.
508	All the best Delainey
509	Kay, can you set up some time - perhaps in the new year for a lunch - my office should be fine.
509	Regards Delainey
510	Guys, I assume you are keeping an eye on "California East".
510	Any help you can give Kevin would be much appreciated.
510	Regards Delainey
511	Patrick, there are two pages missing (ie) Earnings & ROCE.
511	Regards Delainey
512	Brett, under the assumption that we are not over-paying for the land and that the site has option value beyond the Petrobras deal, I am ok with the purchase.
512	Regards Delainey
513	As I had indicated before please work through me or Brett - otherwise we risk our ability to move them - please forward appropriately.
513	Regards Delainey
514	Brett, this looks fine.
514	Regards Delainey
515	Guys, attached you will find a draft org memo that I anticpate going out on Thursday.
515	I appreciate your patience.
515	Please give me any comments ASAP (only major issues).
515	Brian/Tim, I assume that we need a communication strategy to HPL employees before this memo goes out - please advise.
515	Please keep this note confidential until release.
515	Regards Delainey
516	Guys, the outside date on termination due to force majeure was moved to October 31,2002.
516	It is our risk to construct the pipeline;however, it is a breach of contract if Petrobras does not have gas at the site by April 30, Regards Delainey
517	Randy, looks like a good solution - well done.
517	Regards Delainey
518	Rebecca.
518	attached you will find the presentation for the HPL deal.
518	Please forward to Jeff.
518	If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to give me a call.
518	Regards Delainey
519	Rebecca, lets just go forward with HPL on Thursday - Tex Mex, after going through with the deal team, still has some issues to be resolved.
519	We will push this into Q1.
519	The HPL deal is anticipated to be signed on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.
519	Regards Delainey
520	This should be sent from John and me - Enron Americas, Office of the Chairman to all commercial and support employees in Enron North America.
520	In addition, copy to Joe Kishkill, Orlando Gonzales, Brett Wiggs and Remi Collognes in Enron South America.
520	As well, include Jeff Shankman, Mike McConnell, Jeff McMahon, Ray Bowen, Louise Kitchen, Phillipe Bibi, Rebecca McDonald, Jim Hughes, Mark Frevert, Greg Whalley.
520	Please ensure that I am able to proof the final copy before distributing.
520	I would like to have this by Wednesday night in everyone's e-mail Thursday morning.
520	Regards Dave
521	Attached please find the final presentation for the board meeting tommorrow.
521	I assume that RAC will have the resolutions and DASH.
521	Regards Delainey
522	Chris, I need your 2000 accomplishments and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday.
522	Dave
523	Guys, need your 2000 acoomplishments before Friday.
523	Regards Delainey
524	Janet, need 2000 accomplishments and Enron resume/deal anthology for Ben Jacoby and Ed McMichael before Friday - please follow up.
524	Regards Delainey
525	Barry need your 2000 accomplishment and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday Thanks Dave
526	John, I need your 2000 accomplishment and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday.
526	Thanks Dave
527	whats up?
527	Dave
528	Brett, since Enron owns NEPCO - true risk transfer under a fixed price contract is difficult.
528	However, I do like the behaviour that you get from such accountability (ie) high incentive to get done on time and on budget.
528	My experience with NEPCO on cost plus has been very unfavourable (don't like #1).
528	I will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests appropriately.
528	You might want to bounce a few ideas off Dan.
528	I have already given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end of the scale and early.
528	Drop me a note on where you end up.
528	Regards Delainey
529	FYI
530	Dan, it will have to wait - I will be back in early January.
530	Regards Delainey
531	Guys, can you put together the folllowing Portfolio/Charter Review for Principal Investing and Energy Capital Resources: a) detail existing portfolio - winners/losers; additions/deletions and overall performance; b) detail market conditions in your markets and any strategy changes following; c) anticipated major transactions in 2001; and d) review charter and detail any proposed changes.
531	I would anticipate that we sit down with Rick and Jeff at the end of January - please have package available for my review by mid January.
531	Regards Delainey
532	Bill, I think you are confusing me with John Lavorato my COO.
532	I am a University of Saskatchewan grad.
532	Regardless, if I can help lets discuss in the new year.
532	Regards Delainey
533	rick, have a good holiday - John and I appreciate the support you and your group have provided.
533	regards Delainey
534	Eric, as per our discussion, I would suggest that we have no quotes or comments in the press release.
534	As a sale of assets, which we do actively, in a our network strategy there is really nothing positive that can be said without reflecting poorly on the buyer.
534	I would suggest that we approve an AEP press release as we did with Allegheny.
534	If we have not already, I would not send the attached press release to AEP without cutting out the quote.
534	Regards Delainey
535	Rebecca, sorry for the delay - I think that Chris Calger who runs our Western development efforts would be very interested.
535	Chris please give Rebecca a call.
535	Regards Delainey
536	Lisa, I currently work in ENA as CEO and President - mostly nat gas and electricity.
536	Regards Delainey
537	Brett, for US applications dual fuel may be important for Florida - maybe less in California.
537	Do we need it for Rio Gen or Cuiba?
537	Can you follow up with Chris Calger and Janet Dietrich to get their views.
537	Thanks Delainey
538	Janet, I believe a current board member is likely to be picked - last I heard the mayor of Tupelo.
538	Craven will be in office until May.
538	Regards Delainey
539	Chris, thanks for the update - ensure that Azurix is eliminated from the project which can help financially support the Calpine water discount.
539	Do not hesitate to contact Amanda Martin or Garrisson directly on this one if needed.
539	What is the status of LV?
539	Regards Delainey
540	Guys, great job on this one.....
540	2001 - should be a big year for Mexico: a) equity sell down of the Monterrey project; b) close and further sell down of the Tex Mex project; and c) 20% growth on risk mgt volumes and income from 2000 levels.
540	Thanks for the great work.
540	Regards Delainey
541	Janet, between you, Laura and Frank/Gil you should be able to field a one Enron team on this one.
541	I am at your disposal otherwise.
541	Laura/Frank - this is an important one for the team - please work together constructively.
541	Gil should continue in his current role as main relationship manager unless you guys change your mind.
541	Regards Delainey
542	Guys, attached you will find a completed 2001 Pro Forma budget needing Lavo's review and then detailed review with each team.
542	This workbook has a number of worksheets including: a) pkrs o&m - this details the o&m costs for the sold peakers assuming we own throught Q2 - charged to the OOC; b) driftPrepay - shows the detail as provided netting drift and pre-pay expenses - not all that relevant if you assume that increasing drift will be offset by larger monetizations; c) Summary - overall completed income statement - note that non-external capital charges are added back to reach EBIT; d) commercial income - guts of the commercial budget; e) group expenses - shows the detail on ENA net groups expenses, EIS/ENW/IT non-allocable, corporate charges not allocated to specific commercial groups and bonus/other comp; f) HP&L - takes a cut at HP&L income statement and balance sheet in 2001 assuming a sale by the end of Q2 - this needs some sit down work with Redmond; g) Balance Sheet Allocations - this defines by group the capital employed, assets to be sold and new capital expenditures expected in 2001 - then calculates a net capital and depreciation charge; h) Balance Sheet - this defines the existing balance sheet with no anticipated sales or increases by vehicle (ie) Enserco, JEDI, etc - merchant investments are charged @ a blended rate of 15% and strategic investments are charged @ a blended rate of 9%.
542	Two action items: a) Print out for John - Commercial Income & Summary worksheets for his comment and review & b) Start putting completed commercial packages together for distribution/further comment by the business units in the next couple of weeks - include detailed income statement, headcount, balance sheet (including expected increases,decreases, capital charge and depreciation), leave pages open for goals & objectives and target customer list.
542	I would like to review format and detail for each group before distribution.
542	Regards Delainey
543	Guys, in addition please incorporate in each teams package - their Direct Expense/Headcount ratio to plan average, Productivity ratio to plan average and team ROCE to plan average and any variances from 2000 to 2001 for income/expenses taking into account our most latest 2000 forecasts by group.
543	Wes, I assume that you will be putting together a final 2000 i/s package for me in the next couple of days.
543	Thanks Delainey
544	Wes, that is fine - flush it.
544	Regards Delainey
545	yes - we should arrange to get together on Sunday to discuss bonus, comp, promotions and rankings before the PRC on Monday.
545	I am back Saturday night.
545	I hope this works let me know a time.
545	Regards Delainey
546	Wes, I noticed that Laura Scott is not on the list for non-commercial VP candidate but Georgiana and Sherman were - did you change your mind?
546	I think you have until the 4th to put up your candidates.
546	Regards Delainey
547	Jeff, go ahead and have the meeting - I think I know what it is about.
547	Let me know what you guys want to do.
547	Regards Delainey
548	I have certainly missed your one liners - I will give you a call first thing Regards Delainey
549	Chris, work with Dorie Hitchcock and get an estimate/approval memo put together.
549	Regards Delainey
550	Mike, are we closed out on this job with NEPCO as well.
550	Regards Delainey
551	Mark, do we really want a story on SA at this point?
551	Seems we have better things to talk about at this point in time.
551	Regards Delainey
552	Janet, don't trip me up until after January 15.
553	None - except for Enron comp (options et al).
554	Mike, send to John Sherriff in Europe.
554	Regards Delainey
555	Randy, give them what they want and lets move on - don't give another guarantee provide the indemnity for the IRS and environmental claims.
555	Mark if there is a flaw in my thinking let me know.
555	Joe, these guys have been exceedingly difficult to deal with - I would think twice before we bring these guys into any Enron deal in the future.
555	Regards Delainey
556	Rob, what is your view?
556	Regards Delainey
557	Marty, looks like this nut may have some fruit.
557	I look forward to continuing our discussions from 2000 on how we can be better together - I am committed to doing this the right way as I know you are.
557	Regards Delainey
558	Go go go....!!
558	Show us how the retail/wholesale business should work together.
558	Great job!
558	Regards Delainey
559	Brian, please give me your thoughts via e -mail asap.
559	I believe this will be the most effective tool.
559	Please give me your expectations as well.
559	Regards Delainey
560	Jim, I can assure you that neither John or myself are trying to attract blame or "cover our backsides"; however, I do believe that there is/was a genuine breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team, accounting and the desk.
560	As well, it appears that this is not completely a black and white issue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view.
560	As executives of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly.
560	Nevertheless, I think it is amazing we have not had more problems with this divestment given the size, complexity, time and how intertwined it is into the overall framework of ENA.
560	I appreciate your candor and the unselfish maturity to bring to the trading floor.
560	I look forward to working with you as we continue to build our Texas and gas business.
560	Regards Delainey
561	What is this?
561	Regards Delainey
562	Would this guy be a candidate for the LTP?
562	Regards Delainey
563	get rid of this please
564	Brian, good memo - I think you mean't Energy Capital Resources not Enron Capital Resources in your memo.
564	I would distribute widely in the management ranks.
564	Regards Delainey
565	Guys, given all the change and our 2000 success, I would argue that we should have a meeting; however, the challenge is getting people to show up - any thoughts on this Eric/Dorie?
565	Regards Delainey
566	George, it was good to hear from you - please follow up with David Oxley to determine possible roles within ENA.
566	Regards Delainey
567	Jean, the $6M was a negotiated settlement between me and Marty Rosenberg of several old disputes as we moved forward in the restructuring of the Independence plant earlier in the year - Ruth added little other than administrative support.
567	Regards Delainey
568	Mike, as a policy offsites and retreats, especially more exotic and expensive, are being discouraged.
568	I would prefer the Galveston offsite and I don't see a need for more than one per year.
568	Please manage through PR - Dorie Hitchcock - she will require an agenda as part of the approval process.
568	I would encourage some significant work discussion to be part of the offsite.
568	If you have some concerns lets discuss.
568	Regards Delainey
569	Scud incoming....
570	Guys, I am in complete agreement on the strategy.
570	This has been discussed for some time, Dave Duran and his group have distinct goals to move this strategy forward in 2001.
570	Regards Delainey
571	Dave, we need to get this moving before the coal group starts occupying the space.
571	Regards Delainey
572	Can we realistically net transmission costs against CTC undercollections for EES?
572	If there is a credible argument we should discuss.
572	Regards Delainey
573	Mark, you should be there if possible.
573	Regards Delainey
574	Guys, I can't recall how the corporate opportunity is managed between Canada and the US for these customers particularily with regard to their transactions in Michigan et al.
574	Is Eastern Canada now managed by the Central desk from a trading and mid-market point of view since Story came down to Houston?
574	How are the structured deals managed?
574	Is this still the right split for the business?
574	Regards Delainey
575	Kay please send regrets - I think I am in Canada.
575	Regards Delainey
576	Hey, Rob try and keep under $100K US.
576	Regards Delainey
577	Rob, if you and Dave think this is your best branding opportunity in the short run as we gear up I am supportive.
577	I assume this will be covered in Canada's budget.
577	Send me a towel.
577	Regards Delainey
578	yes
579	Kay, please ensure that her expense statements are signed by me.
579	Regards Delainey
580	Kyle, sounds like a good deal - look forward to this play bearing fruit.
580	Thanks Dave
581	Rob, can you discuss with the other groups to appropriately sort out the corporate opportunity (ie) Laura, Hunter, etc. Dave
582	Guys, can you work with Milly on this issue.
582	Regards Delainey
583	Greg, nothing that pressing - I was just wondering how things were going and wanted to catch up on few things.
583	Regards Delainey
584	Guys, I'm not the sharing type - book me in the Forest Room.
584	Regards Delainey
585	Yours!
586	Guys, where do we stand with Tom and the replacement combustion systems?
586	Regards Delainey
587	Ken, I'm a lowly piker but I will try to help.
587	Regards Delainey
588	John, what do you want to do with this?
588	We had discussed but I wanted to follow up.
588	Regards Delainey
589	Kevin, the only thing to keep in mind are the patent issues on the DLN - the GE settlement prevents PSM from re-manufacturing any further "tainted" product including spares for the existing DLN system - how might this affect our reliability at peak times?
589	Regards Delainey
590	ok, your call - do we have some spares available if needed?
590	regards Delainey
591	Guys, I do not have any material that Brian, Tim or Wes would not have in their files.
591	Regards Delainey
592	John, I assume that you are doing the review for Vince Kaminski.
592	Thanks Dave
593	Jeff, I assume that you are providing a review for Mike L Miller.
593	Thanks Dave
594	Brian, I assume that you are doing the review for Bob Virgo, Wayne Mays, Jean Mrha and Julie Gomez.
594	Regards Delainey
595	These are the reviews that I have completed or nearing completion: - Dave Duran - Scott Josey - Brian Redmond - Janet Dietrich - John Thompson - Jeff Donahue - Kay Chapman David, Greg told me that you were going to create a master list of reviews/reviewers to be completed to ensure that the Wholesale OOC's catches all commercial and non-commercial direct reports.
595	I would suggest that we follow up with a master list for each business unit to ensure that all reviews are completed across ENA much like the process we undertook at mid-year.
595	I would shoot for 100% participation target.
595	How are we making out on the NIM/Issues folks in ENA - either out the door or completed plans?
595	Regards Delainey
596	Jeff, I assume that you are doing Lydecker, Maffitt and Detmering's review.
596	thanks Dave
597	Janet, if you are ok, I'm ok - we usually only sign these type of non-solicitations, stand-stills or non-competes if we are well down the road towards having a reasonable probability to completing a transaction with the counterparty.
597	Otherwise, it becomes a nightmare to manage all these.
597	I will leave it to your discretion.
597	Regards Delainey
598	Dan, sounds like we are moving backwards - but these guys tend to jump the gun at times.
598	If it is not possible for these orgs to work together lets not try and force them (ie) we will manage our own business and contract with NEPCO when and if it makes sense.
598	Regards Delainey
599	Guys, do we have enough VAR to bring this position into the book?
599	If over $5M in total exposure it has to go to Frevert/Whalley.
599	John, I assume that you have gone through the transaction and have approved.
599	Regards Delainey
600	Wes, do you have the first cut?
600	John you need to have some input.
600	Regards Delainey
601	Ken, I will drive by - I am interested in looking at a few options.
601	thanks Dave
602	fyi, action
603	Guys, as a follow on to our discussion last week: a) run the RFP for VN service for Electro - variety of terms, volumes as per our discussion - next thirty days - Orlando; b) explore the possibility of adding four additional LM's to the Electrobolt structure as a form of generation mitigation for the Electro short - would Petrobras be open to this discussion and what would be the last date that we would have to call NTP to get in on time to make 2003 - Joe; c) as much information on the nature of the Electro short and any customer contractual positions that can be provided to Lavo to start estimating the value of the possible straddle - Orlando d) re-run the Cuiba MTM model given changing cost parameters, fuel issues and timing to determine what the possible hit may be and what are the mitigants - Joe; e) re-run budget numbers with correct view on re-organization costs - Joe; f) view on financial budget and strategic goals for 2001 and feedback to ESA g) update commercial org chart reflecting discussions about the origination teams - Joe; and h) clarification on sale and asset responsibility in SA on a go forward basis given changing opinions on effectiveness of current organization - Lavo.
603	Outsourcing contacts: b) Peoples Gas - Laura Luce c) Virginia Natural Gas - Ed McMichael d) Brooklyn Union - Ed McMichael Regards Delainey
604	Janet, the CALME organization does not exist so it might be difficult to negotiate a transfer price - we need to just do the right thing for Enron - if you think you are getting stuffed economically then I would work a deal out with Lavo or Whalley.
604	Regards Delainey
605	Dan, should we put more meat on this bone?
605	Regards Delainey
606	FYI, Ken we may want you to speak to Peevey and Freeman.
606	I believe that discussion should frame the proposal and attempt to set up a meeting with his staff and advisors to answer questions about credit and documentation.
606	In the propsal, we have tried to frame the potential credit and legal holes in their RFP with our suggested language or documents.
606	It would be helpful for the commercial team in ENA/EES to meet with these gentlemen and their advisors to describe the proposal and perhaps move towards negotiating a transaction.
606	The proposal includes: a) traded power products of various sizes and terms; b) unit contigent tolls from Pastoria (750MW) and Las Vegas Cogen (222MW) for term; c) natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide gas hedges for their QF portfolio or other contracted merchant toll contracts; and d) an preliminary proposal on DSM from EES.
606	I will forward an executive summary from Chris Calger with more detail.
606	Regards Delainey
607	FYI, refer to previous note.
608	Steve, write these down in pencil - I need a chance to review.
608	thanks Dave
609	Steve, I only have the following suggestion for the Office of the Chairman paragraph: "Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES. Joining Dave, in the Office of the Chairman, will be Marty Sunde, as President, Global Marketing Services and Dan Leff, as President, Global Energy Services. Dan and Marty have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES business model. In addition, Janet Dietrich will join the Office of the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer. Currently, Janet is Managing Director in Enron Americas where she had successfully led both trading and origination organizations."
609	Regards Delainey
610	John, I asked Brian to investigate taking a number of ESA's engineering folks into his central Technical Services group.
610	These folks would continue to work on ESA's projects but would get the resources and support of the centralized body particularily in their negotiations with outside vendors including NEPCO and OEC.
610	It would also be another linkage into the SAmerican business from Houston to help monitor and defray technical and development risk.
610	Lets see if Kishkill and Redmond get to the right answer.
610	Regards Delainey
611	FYI
612	Mike, Brian Redmond Dave
613	Jaime, appreciate all your efforts and I am sure you will find a way to hit your targets this year.
613	Regards Delainey
614	a) year end reviews - report needs generating like mid-year documenting business unit performance on review completion - David to John; b) work out or plan generation for the NIM/Issues employees - David to John; c) HPL transition issues - ongoing.
614	Officially transferred.
614	Regards Delainey
615	Laura, I know you are busy but I need your plan submission asap so that we can discuss and finalize.
615	Regards Delainey
616	Rob, I need your re-submission of the plan document including goals and objective asap so that we can have a final discussion and finalize.
616	We should also set up some time to finalize your review.
616	Regards Delainey
617	Matthew, would your Monday meeting be a good time (if the time change works) for me to introduce myself and say a few words via video conference or the like to your organization?
617	Regards Delainey
618	fyi, action

635	thxs Ricardo regards Delainey
636	Scott, I apologize that no one talked to you before this one went out.
636	I assumed that Marty or Dan had spoken to you as we discussed this initial change; however, I take full responsibility.
636	I will guarantee it won't happen again.
636	My understanding is that you have been a significant contributor to EES strategy and success.
636	You can count on a lot more discussion about which markets and products are core in the few weeks and you will be leading a market opportunity.
636	I have asked Kay to set up some time for us to discuss the market and the future next week.
636	If that is not soon enough, I am around all day today.
636	Regards Delainey
637	Ed, thanks for the note - hope things are going well.
637	Regards Delainey
638	Scott, I appreciate your note and I am sure that you will work well with Chris.
638	I have always believed in your talents and capabilities - I won't be far ....
638	Regards Delainey
639	Richard, it is my understanding that this investment is currently in Ray Bowen's business.
639	In my ENA shoes, I would say we would have no interest in taking on that responsibility.
639	In my EES shoes, I would like to take a closer look at the possible connections.
639	Please send me some info on the investment fund and their current investments portfolio.
639	I have also heard that Tom White has been talking to you about EES taking on the Catalytica investment.
639	With my EES shoes on, no way!!!!
639	Regards Delainey
640	I'm sorry Bob - AMPS
641	Bob, please give me an update on our progress on this item and the viability of the technology.
641	Regards Delainey
642	Matthew, Janet and I are going to come your way before March 12th.
642	I'll give you a call to discuss further.
642	Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday: - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron and EES; - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001; - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for the large industrial customer); - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that effort; - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals; - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - no bullshit politics; - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership; - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success; - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February early March.
642	PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.
642	Talk to you soon!!
642	Regards Delainey
643	Mike, please let Brian know if there is a problem and let him rectify.
643	It is difficult for me to be responsive otherwise.
643	Thanks Dave
644	Hey Crystal hope things are well ....
644	Dawna is fine.
644	We have two girls six (Kassandra) and four (Samantha).
644	We have been in Houston now three and half years.
644	It has been a good move from a career point of view.
644	Obviously, you had heard my move from Pres./CEO of Enron North America to Chair/CEO of EES.
644	I hope life has been as kind to you.
644	Best of luck in the future.
644	Regards Delainey
645	Matthew, if you know my reputation, I tend not to be a big fan of these type of events either - however, at this point, I need to collect more information on the event and I think it inappropriate to cancel at this late stage.
645	Going forward, I think we as a management team including yourself should discuss what the strategy should be going forward.
645	Don't hesitate to voice your opinion.
645	Regards Delainey
646	Matthew, sounds fine - I will have Kay start managing the calendar.
646	Regards Delainey
647	Chris, I would get Mark or Louise involved at this point - if it is mission critical let me know.
647	Regards Delainey
648	no
649	Joe, I will forward his voice mail to you.
649	EES has enough challenges in NA and Europe before tackling retail products and services in a market with no wholesale market.
649	Please follow up.
649	Thanks Delainey
650	David, I'm not sure there is any value to this for EES North America.
650	There are well known and documented controls and process issues in the mid, back and risk offices of the company.
650	We are working quickly to rectify - servicing your needs at the same time would slow us down.
650	On the European side, I would like your perspective on their controls and business.
650	Regards
651	thanks Rick By the way, JCP is being restructured or killed.
651	Regards Delainey
652	thxs ben - i'm sure our paths will cross again.
652	best of luck.
652	regards delainey
653	thanks Peter - and congrats on the promotion well deserved.
653	Keep actively managing constructively your constituency in Houston.
653	Regards Delainey
654	John, I spoke to Milly - he is on side.
654	I have completed all reviews except Kishkill and Orlando - how do you want to handle this?
654	Regards Delainey
655	Ken, fyi Regards Dave
656	Thanks Chris - I assume you are speaking about credit risk on the thirty day deal when you refer to the $2M exposure on $100 - has Tim spoken to John about this?
656	I am supportive of this proposal and approach.
656	Like our discussion, we have to find a way to be supportive to the re-development of this market without creating un-acceptable credit or market losses.
656	We also have to support Lay's efforts in California.
656	Regards Delainey
657	Sherri, I will be there.
657	Regards Delainey
658	Peggy, the last version I read was fine.
658	Regards Delainey
659	Kay, are we in London during this event?
659	Regards Delainey
660	Vicki, how much $$ are we talking about for the bankruptcy and the class action suit?
660	It does not seem inappropriate for us to share the bankruptcy costs given the CTC issue.
660	I agree with you on the class action suit.
660	Lets discuss further before we approach ENA.
660	Regards Delainey
661	Kay, please ensure I get to this.
661	Dave
662	Kay, I forwarded a message to you from Sheri Sierra from a gentleman looking for energy mgt services in Japan.
662	I had asked you to forward to Joe Hirl.
662	Please follow up with Joe.
662	Regards Delainey
663	Just practicing apathy.
663	Regards Delainey
664	all yours
665	just send it out to the affected parties.
666	FYI
667	Ray, in EES, the Construction Services (also known as EFS) companies operate on a stand alone basis from Enron and have clear liquidation value to the parents - EES and Enron Corp. It is my opinion that we should be trying to "un-buckle" these companies from Enron over the short term to ensure their continued viablility as we find a sale.
667	In my view un-buckling means a) stop the factoring of any Construction Services receivables that end up moving cash out of Construction Services up into the parents; b) utilizing those receivables plus, if necessary, Enron's interest in Construction Services to obtain sufficient collateral to renew the St. Paul surety bond.
667	This surety bond is necessary to continue contracting; and c) terminate the sweeping of cash from Construction Services bank accounts to Corp immediately.
667	There will be a meeting early next week with St Paul to renew the surety bond.
667	I am hopeful that meeting these conditions will be enough to reinstate the surety bond.
667	The Construction Services group employs approximately 2,600 people and is worth (given current backlog) between $100 and $125 million dollars.
667	Mark and his team are actively trying to sell over the next 60 to 90 days and we control 100% of the stock of this company.
667	The other part half of the former EFS is the Facility Services group (also know as ServiceCo).
667	Again, these companies largely operate independently of Enron and have going concern value outside of Enron.
667	Currently, we have outside technology and financial partners in the Facility Services Groups that make it impossible to factor receivables or move cash out of Facility Services bank accounts without the approval of the board which includes several outside directors.
667	We currently own approximately 85% of the firm that employs approximately 1,400 people and is worth minimum $50 million dollars (cash value).
667	Mark and his team are actively trying to sell or otherwise dispose over the next 60 to 90 days.
667	EES also manages several joint ventures (DSM and O&M related mostly) with customers where we would have to have outside approvals to move cash out of these entities.
667	These include Owens Corning Energy LLC (Owens Corning), LE Hesten Energy LLC (Lily), Tenant Services Inc. (Simon Properties), EBC Property LLC and Enron Distributed Energy Services LLC.
667	In all cases, we need to be observant of corporate governance issues with these entities.
667	As officers, I thought it prudent to ensure that you and your team had all available information.
667	I would also like your approval to move forward with my recommendations for the Construction Services group as above.
667	We appreciate everything you are doing.
667	Regards Dave Delainey
668	pls approve
669	OK
670	Guys, the plan,as I am currently aware: a) Gas - as per our conversation this AM - press on; b) Power - start with the California customers post June and the Enron Direct books; c) follow on with the rest of the power book once we are getting traction on (b) above.
670	Thanks Dave
671	Oz, where are you on the WIP DSM "buckets"?
671	Dave
672	Wade, you need to give George and Ray more texture ie) we lose $30M in value - in active sale mode that looks promising and we buy Enron ten days with New York ISO.
672	Been approved by Rogers Herndon (Risk) and Dave Delainey Regards Delainey
673	Jeff, possible buyer.
673	What are we doing with the NEPool Book - are we selling?
673	Regards Delainey
674	Dick, thanks for the e-mail.
674	I don't think I disagree with any of the points you made and I do think we have come a long way over the last year in the DSM "technology" we employ.
674	Unfortunately, a lot of these changes in thinking, sales and cost structure are too little too late.
674	It is highly unlikely at this point that EES will exist beyond next week.
674	All the best in the future and I would like to personally thank you for your contribution, thought process and caring to the end to make your point.
674	Regards Delainey
675	Ray, as per your request see attached:: The bottom line we will need approximately $82M for the month of December in order to maintain an asset worth approximately $375M.
675	The vast majority 80%+ is prepaid energy which will be recovered from the customer.
675	It is highly likely that we will be able to sell this book.
676	Guys, it would be great to be able to go off-site in two different locations for these guys but given the fact I had to personally buy the paper for copying the termination packages, I don't think there any funds to spend.
676	Perhaps there are empty offices in 3 Allen.
676	Please look into.
676	Either way we need to ensure that these guys are fairly well seperated.
676	I am waiting for a confidentiality from Calpine and AEP this AM.
676	Regards Delainey
677	ok to pay
678	Court would have to approve any reduction or significant change that we would do outside the normal course of business - short answer probably no on the non-compete otherwise we are down to 100 people have at it.
678	Regards Delainey
679	NERCO is waiting .......
680	Where are you DSM boy?
681	NERCO is waiting ....
682	I am now officially a Blackberry addict .....
683	What's up
684	Thanks Mike - you can contact me at my Enron number for the next couple of months otherwise at 713-592-9723.
684	Dave
685	Peter, I do not have a contact at RWE but if you need a reference let me know.
685	You can continue to contact me at my Enron phone over the next several weeks.
685	Best of luck Dave
686	Peter, I don't have any contacts at RWE; however, if you need a reference do not hesitate to give me a call.
686	I will be at the Enron number for the next several weeks.
686	All the best in the future.
686	Regards Delainey
687	Thanks
688	Hang in there guys....
688	I'll come have a beer with you guys later.
688	Let me know where you might be.
688	Dave
689	What's going on?
689	Dave
690	guys, please ensure that this is handled.
690	Regards Delainey
691	Jen, probably done with ENE early in the new year and then determine next steps.
691	Take care.
691	Regards Dave
692	Jen, no calls from Sempra - I hear San Diego is nice:)
693	Dan, are you managing or do we need to discuss?
693	Regards Delainey
694	Jimmie, I assume that you and Tracey are formulating the options and populating the detailed financials on those options for the board meeting next week.
694	It would be great if we could see that a couple days in advance.
694	David, we should probably call a follow up board meeting for next Wednesday or Thursday.
694	Vicki, we need to speak about the board participation issues and the cash management issues discussed.
694	Regards Delainey
695	Thanks Judy - you are doing the right things and it is important!
695	Regards Dave
696	Kay, please set up a meeting to discuss in detail the Lily transaction and next steps - tomorrow or the next day.
696	Regards Delainey
697	Kalen/Dan, please provide guidance for Scott and let me know.
697	Scott, we are pretty much in a bind on most of this.
697	I will see what we can do.
697	Regards Delainey
698	the knuckleheads still rule ....
698	we are still here waiting .....
698	Dave
699	Mike, I would agree with your point that we will be attempting to sell the services (DSM/O&M) currently provided by EES to Hensen LLC.
699	Other than a heads up to Jimmie given the potential effects to EBSI, I am assuming that you and Jeremy et al are managing the sale.
699	Given the amount of work in front of Jimmie around EFS generally (sale of ConstructionCo and restructuring of ServiceCo, I would hope not to overload Jimmie on another sale process. Thoughts? Regards Delainey
700	What are we doing with Rexam?
700	Regards Delainey
701	David, I am ok anytime next Wed or Thursday.
701	Just let Kay know.
701	Thxs Regards Delainey
702	Jimmie, agree; however, EES cannot immediately convey these agreements to EBSI as a sub-contractor permanently post bankruptcy.
702	Under bankruptcy, we need to show an auction process.
702	In the cases, where EBSI has contracted directly with the client - I think we are ok.
702	Vicki please add some texture if required.
702	Regards Delainey
703	Vicki, I would have Janet, Dan, Jeremy, Scott.
703	Regards Delainey
704	Mark, ....
704	starting to move..
704	have a few ideas ....
704	the natives are restless...
704	when are you returning to the mother ship?
704	Regards Delainey
705	Don, can you go through your Canadian gas book and let me know all the positions and customers.
705	We are planning on putting Enron Energy Services Canada into bankruptcy and need to understand the contracts.
705	Regards Delainey
706	thank you
707	Deborah, I have received your letter dated December 18, 2001 and I will ensure that you get a follow up.
707	To give you a little texture on the issues, all pre-petition expense statements (Dec 2, 2001) were frozen subject to an overall approval by the bankruptcy court on what could be paid.
707	At this point, we have approval to pay up to $5K immediately and possibly up to $15K per pre-petition expense statement.
707	This part of the bankruptcy process.
707	It is actually harder to get pre-petition expenses paid than post-petition.
707	Unless I have my facts wrong, you should have been paid already or are in the queue.
707	Either Kalen or Dan will follow up.
707	If not please give me a call at 713-853-3829.
707	Regards Delainey
708	No bid for the barges:) Better technology in the market regardless of price - these puppies are going to be tough to move.
708	Regards Delainey
709	Thanks much guys - much appreciate it.
709	Have a good new year.
709	Dave

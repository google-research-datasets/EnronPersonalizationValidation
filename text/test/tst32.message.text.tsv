0	Below are the assumptions agreed for booking the New Albany spread option: EPMI East Power Book pays New Albany a fixed demand charge for the next 5 years as follows: As consideration for the demand charge, EPMI has the right to "toll" gas through the facility and receive power in return at a fixed heat rate conversion factor of 12.5 MMBtu/Mwh.
0	In addition EPMI will pay New Albany $1000 per start (for maintenance reserve fund) and $1.00/Mwh for variable operating costs.
0	The New Albany, LLC will receive an 8% return on capital.
0	Book value will be depreciated from $409/kW basis on 1/1/2001 to $336/kW on 12/31/2005.
0	The facility output assumption is 360 MW with a 95% availability in the summer and 75% availability in the winter.
0	Jenny - Please revise the booking of New Albany in Rogers book effective tonight.
1	Below are the EPMI proposed bid/offer spreads for EES.
1	These are very aggressive markets given the liquidity issues and regulatory uncertainty that still exist in the Eastern Interconnect.
1	There are no other counterparties in the market that will consistently make the proposed 2-ways.
2	The following is the understanding I have with Chris Calger regarding Scott Healy's involvement in East Power initiatives: Since Auburndale is effectively dead, Scott will no longer be involved on this project.
2	Scott will support the Haywood, Georgia, & Calvert City development site sales through Q1 2001, with East Power getting 100% of the P&L value and Scott Healy getting personal performance credit.
2	If Ben elects to continue to use Scott's services beyond Q1 2001, a value sharing agreement between Ben, Calger and myself will have to be agreed upon.
2	Jeff Ader will make a decision (after consultation with me) as to Scott's continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and Dighton restructuring project.
2	If Jeff makes the decision that Scott needs to remain actively involved in order to close the transaction, a value sharing agreement will be made between Jeff, Calger, and myself.
2	The value allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week.
2	If a fair value sharing agreement cannot be reached, Jeff will transition responsibility to another member of his origination team.
2	Chris - Do you agree with the above description?
3	New Albany will accept proposal assuming my deductible is limited to $1 million per occurence and my BI deductible is limited to 30 days and includes full replacement revenue (less marginal fuel costs) after the 30 day period.
4	John Dorbone (sp?).
4	You can get his phone # on Gleannochfarms.com web site.
4	They have 4 custom builders (Tom Bailey, Pine Oak, Country Village, and Tom Hale).
4	They recently fired Coventry and Frederick Harris.
4	I have not made a decision yet, but I am considering Gleannloch as an alternative.
4	It would be a big positive for me if you could build the house.
5	I would recommend sitting with the real-time traders (they trade, reserve transmission and schedule the power in real-time).
5	You can coordinate with me.
6	FYI - Please follow-up.
7	Congrats Janice and good look with your new job.
8	Rogers and I have our weekly trader's roundtable meeting, so we are not available for the tour.
9	Thanks for the update.
9	I also talked to John and he expressed the same doubt.
10	Please follow-up.
10	Thanks
11	Yes attend.
12	Make sure we keep all visitors at a considerable distance from the trading floor.
13	Please make sure that all visitors maintain a considerable distance from the trading floor.
13	Thanks.
14	They need to talk with Ed Baughman to define a deal structure.
15	FYI - Org.
15	Chart.
15	Do you want me to have my asst.
15	replicate for the West?
16	I have your list and will be sending you an e-mail shortly.
16	Thanks.
17	Thanks for your contact list.
17	Enron also looks forward to working with Oneok.
17	Attached is a list of individuals (with titles) within our trading organization whom you will be interacting with.
17	Please call me with any questions.
18	FYI.
19	Your summary is accurate.
19	I appreciate you and Fred coming to Houston for the de-briefing and we look forward to extending our exclusive relationship.
19	Thanks.
20	I had to leave early yesterday so I am just getting around to reviewing.
20	Looks good.
20	I will call with any comments.
20	Thanks Tim.
21	Right now.
22	Org chart for today's meeting.
23	Thanks Pearce.
24	We would like to hire Willis Phillips from Koch.
24	Rogers, Dana, & I have all interviewed him and think he is a can't miss candidate.
24	The bad news is that he was referred by a headhunter (the fee is 20% of first year package).
24	This guy is quality and I want to make an offer.
24	Please let me know if I can proceed ASAP.
25	Change the request to 150 MW per period.
25	Thanks.
26	When do the guys that signed contracts get the paperwork for option grants and restricted stock?
26	They are all asking me.
27	No I'm not OK with this.
27	We have never paid in the past.
27	Is it different if we request 02 only?
28	Willis is an Manager candidate
29	I tore the Agreement up because he would not sign it.
30	The first report looked good, however, I would like to see the owner name, and technical configuration.
30	In addition, I would like pictures of each facility.
31	As I told John this morning, we have similar issues with Var in the East.
31	The correlations between gas & power for the entire curve are based on the front month and the correlations between regions are also based on the front month.
31	I have requested changes to the Var calc several months back and have been assured it will be completed by the research group soon.
32	Can you send me another copy of the pros/cons matrix and the function descriptions.
32	Thanks.
33	I gave you his resume 3 months ago.
33	I am sending another copy upstairs today.
33	He would be a manager level hire.
33	No, he is not the ex-metals trader.
33	I would like to hire this guy ASAP.
34	Are you OK with this?
35	FYI - Another opportunity for mid-market to extract value from the market.
36	Please print and put in binder for me (4 tabs for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
36	Thanks.
37	What is this?
38	What is their proposal?
39	Doug Gilbert-Smith, fletch sturm, rogers herndon, rob benson, and mark dana davis.
40	Can I get the interview package (including resume) Thanks.
41	I need a summary on this issue.
41	Thanks.
42	A written summary is fine.
43	The genco room needs to be with power and the size needs to be increased as requested by Lloyd Will.
44	Joe is set to rotate to real-time MW on June 1 and Bill Rust is taking his scheduling place.
44	I have no problem with Joe going with you.
44	With respect to Narsima, timing may be an issue (transition), however, I should be able to make that happen as well.
44	With Busby, Bernie, Joe and Narsima (timing an issue), you have some competent support at the outset In addition, there is almost certainly some capable people within the 200 person existing organization that have had no management direction and no discipline.
44	Hopefully, the dust settles and the transition can start next Monday.
44	We also need to figure out what we do with your existing positions.
45	No electronic copy - Evelyn saved a hard copy.
45	The quote was related to Enron's activity with TVA.
46	Let's discuss this at our 3:00 pm meeting today.
46	Please put on agenda.
46	Thanks.
47	I will do the interview.
47	Please schedule with my asst.
47	(TJ Black at 3-5800)
48	Tuesday April 17th.
49	I would like to acknowledge David Portz for his hard work and diligence in drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the Green Mountain Power all-requirements transaction in ERCOT.
49	David worked long hours ensuring all tight timelines were met and facilitated quick contract turnarounds on numerous occasions.
49	In addition to Green Mountain, David has exhibited the same hard work and diligence on other Texas transactions (San Antonio, misc. QSE contracts, etc.)
50	I'm not in the business of providing firm pricing via e-mail.
50	As always, all prices from the desk are indicative until customer is ready to pull the trigger.
50	As a rule of thumb, prices are good for about 15 minutes.
50	Therefore, let's be clear with the counterparty that we are in a volatile energy market with pricing moving 5-10% on some days.
50	For example, summer power is down $20.00/Mwh over the past week and June is down $10/Mwh.
50	Summer 02 and summer 03 are down $7-8/Mwh over the past 3 days.
50	Thanks.
51	I forgot to mention that today's curves will be down another 5%, therefore, the prices in the spreadsheet are too high.
52	Thanks for the hard copies.
52	Can you please send me an e-mail with an electronic copy.
53	I received them.
53	Thanks.
54	No, I have sent 3 copies to Lavo.
55	No development is easy.
55	I see nothing on your list that cannot be overcome.
55	Please develop a plan to have a 150 MW on-line my May 02 with rented diesel equipment.
55	We would install the diesels at OPPD distribution substations.
55	We may have to do 15 different installations to acheive the desired result.
55	Last year Com-Ed and IPL completed an installation with CATs in 3 months.
55	The key is to get OPPD to cooperate with interconnections at the distribution substations and we will get credit for losses.
55	Please work with Terri and Ed.
55	If you need any additional info after working through a plan with Terri and Ed, please let me know.
56	Agreed.
56	Thanks.
57	FYI - Can you help Ron sort through these issues.
57	With OPPD's cooperation, we can easily overcome these issues and make May 02 in-service for 150 MW of rented diesel generation installed at OPPD distribution substations.
58	500k right now.
58	I am prepared to pay a $1 million development fee as well.
59	Highly Confidential
60	My candidates are already through their rotations and are essentially finished with what we have defined as the trading track.
61	White water rafting in Colorado.
62	I submitted my request to Kim Melodick approx.
62	1 week ago.
62	Kim - Please make sure Lavo and Louise have my wish list for Analyst and Associate candidates.
63	Ground pictures from various angles will do.
63	My expectation is that I will continue to get weekly updates and the booklet I described will contain the info I requested in an organized manner.
63	Thanks.
64	Yes it is irrelevant.
64	Now that we have competent risk managers making the decision, they will know how to effectively hedge these deals.
64	Furthermore, pricing is always available on demand.
64	When each trader has 30-40 products to manage in a volatile market, they are not necessarily going to put 03-10 for peak and off-peak in every region.
64	It becomes very cumbersome to manage the year over year spreads when the front is moving so violently.
65	As you probably know, Rogers (in the East) and Don (in the West) will be working directly with the wholesale desk.
65	Tim and I will ensure a fair balance is achieved between retail and wholesale.
65	As an Enron shareholder, I fully appreciate that we need explosive growth and profitability out of EES, particularly with reduced volatility in gas and power markets over the next several years.
65	I am commited to ensuring that the retail risk management organization is offered all the tools, information, systems, competitive pricing, etc. to allow EES to offer fully bundled competitively priced products to retail customers.
65	I look forward to working with you and Dave in continuing to grow this business.
66	Willis should be an Associate trading track position.
66	I forgot to clarify with Kim on original offer.
66	Remember, we have to go through Paul Johnson at Austin Energy.
66	I would like to get the offer letter out today.
67	I would like 6 Analysts and 4 Associates.
67	I provided my top 20 wish list to Lavo last week.
67	Thanks.
68	Plant development should focus on sites in NY City.
68	You assumptions are correct related to NE.
69	Thanks for the update John.
69	I have a great personal relationship with Paul Posoli (run there whole shop), so if you need anything let me know.
70	Great trading asset, but fixed costs are enormous.
70	The entire value proposition is based upon $15/Mwh spread between peak and off-peak (which is clearly there today).
70	My view is this spread collapses over time due to DSM/DG/real-time pricing and true hourly price signals in pool based markets.
70	We should look at the asset, but recognize the fixed costs are huge.
71	In the interim, Fletch and I will assume responsibility.
71	Obviously, we will be trying to identify a replacement over the next couple of months.
71	We will be doing some position re-alignment today - transferring some of Rogers positions to Fletch and/or myself at tonight's mids.
71	I will then re-sell/re-buy some positions back to Rogers which cancel out opposite positions in the retail book.
71	I will give you the specifics before we mark.
72	We should be pursuing the buyout and asset development simultaneously and the most economic alternative will prevail.
73	Sounds good.
73	I think we will significant synergy benefits immediately.
73	The cultural barriers will be broken down and information will flow from wholesale to retail and vice versa.
74	If I can find it.
75	I'm sure Vlady can get it to you.
75	In general, I don't save my e-mails.
76	I would like another 15" monitor mounted on my trading desk. When can I get this done.
77	I did look and couldn't find it.
78	Thanks Charles and I agree with your conclusion - a competitive market will not exist unless the tools create a clear price signal for all congestion.
79	I need prudency C summaries ASAP.
79	Thanks.
80	I talked with Gary Hickerson and I am OK with granting Michelle Cisneros access for her specific valuation purpose (pricing access is for 2 years only).
81	Fletch and I are dividing up Rogers postions (Fletch taking Peak, I'm taking Off-Peak).
81	To make it fair on everyone, I am allowing Rogers to take $4 million from Prudency C attached to JEA.
81	(Rogers has created this positive balance himself over the past 12 months with deals he has done in FL & SOCO).
81	In addition, I will be assuming all customer deals (VEPCO, JEA, Associated, MPMUC).
81	We will mark the curves in Entergy and TVA where Fletch is comfortable taking the position (off-peak also needs to be marked down).
81	The $4 million from prudency will absorb most of the curve shift.
81	All of Rogers postions will stay in Wholesale.
81	All parties come out with a fair solution.
82	Lloyd Will, Juan Hernandez and Don Baughman (plus Kayne Coulter) should be the East Power reps at this meeting.
83	Please begin working on filling our Associated short position in 02.
83	I would like to take this risk off the books.
83	In addition, please find out what a buy-out of VEPCO would cost us.
83	With Rogers transitioning to run our retail risk management, I would like to clean up our customer positions.
83	We also need to continue to explore a JEA buy-out.
83	Thanks.
84	His resume looked good.
84	I'm OK with the hire.
85	Fine.
85	Use the same charge code you have been using.
86	If it becomes an asset management deal, we need to involve the services desk (Tom May and Jeff Miller).
86	The trading & marketing outsourcing deal is the most appealing to me.
87	No development as of yet.
88	Next week is better.
88	Please schedule an afternoon appt.
88	with my asst.
88	(Tamara Black 3-5800)
89	If you don't get a response from Elizabeth, just call her or walk up to the legal floor.
89	On something as important as this, I would go directly to Elizabeth's office.
90	For 01 and 02, congestion/energy uplift/transmission uplift is $3.50 to $4.50/Mwh.
90	Current EES curves are light in this area.
90	For 03 & beyond when LMP is adopted in NE ISO and socialized allocation is eliminated, the congestion component alone in the Boston area will be well over $10/Mwh (based on actual congestion $'s from May 99 to date in the Boston area).
90	Much like the Dallas situation, these locational congestion charges can be significant and Rogers and Don will begin immediately developing delivered energy pricing curves for specific locations that go well beyond the wholesale pricing points we mark right now.
90	I hope this helps.
91	I think there a great DG opportunities in both Boston and Manhattan.
91	We will be working hard over the next several weeks to get proper city-gate curves in place to reflect true location marginal pricing, particularly in areas where we have exposure and new deal activity.
91	thanks.
92	Kim, Add another 8-10 for retail risk management.
92	You can take from the same list I have already provided to you and Lavo.
93	I need project names next to these que spots, including the project sponsor.
93	I can't make a determination unless I know the specific project and the project owner.
94	I still need the info I requested to comment intelligently.
95	Attend.
96	ICAP exposure needs to be capped at the default price (currently 8.75/kW/mo).
96	Because Zone J is deficient capacity, the market is actually trading higher than the default rate.
96	In addition, we need to scrub the ancillary components.
97	We need to add Jay Lewis and 4-5 people with T&D tariff knowledge to the curve team as well.
97	This process will entail specific wholesale curves plus a complete review of the T&D tariff curves.
97	These teams need to work together to ensure the sum of the parts equal the whole.
97	I am assuming everyone on the team agrees.
98	We have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and/or balance of month trading (with no forward trading).
98	It would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within EOL that allowed for better credit screening.
98	We have moved away from the broker markets, and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties.
98	I would like to get this changed ASAP, if possible.
98	Thanks.
99	Friday is a terrible day for tours in power.
99	My entire desk leaves at 2:00 pm on Friday.
99	I would suggest the gas floor for this tour.
99	The customer will be very unimpressed if we have limited staff here in the middle of the day.
100	Remember our deal.
100	After trading day is over (for next 2 months), you stay until the risk calcs are done and help in whatever manner is necessary to improve the process.
100	In addition, you should take responsibility for calcing the ERCOT books (term and cash).
101	Can we make 02.
101	FPL needs 02 start dates.
102	Is JEA deal booked against FL/GA curve or SERC curve?
103	Sounds like you are on the team.
103	I am assuming you will start full-time on Monday.
103	Whalley has already assured me you will be part of this re-build process which obviously requires full-time focus.
103	Please confirm.
104	Thanks.
104	It never hurts to ask.
105	Your perception is correct.
105	Remember 4 years of culture is at work here.
105	I told Rogers this morning, we have to move to 35, clearly define the process for pricing deals, and begin changing the mindset of the marketing organization with respect to value.
105	The whole situation on 6 is considerably worse than I originally thought.
106	Have you spoke to Greg Whalley about Kristen Albrecht, Dierdra McCaffery, Jim Brysch, and Heather Kendall.
106	We need to move forward on putting these teams together, and the above individuals were key candidates indentified to re-build the retail risk management organization over the next 6-9 months.
106	I would like to hear back today on how we plan on proceeding with these individuals.
106	Thanks.
107	Thanks.
108	East Power is flat.
109	Yes, you are correct.
109	Todd is making the changes I requested and we probably have at least another 2 weeks before I get a final plan.
109	With respect to your latest Contract, I have 2 minor changes.
109	The only one with any significance is the counterparty name.
109	I expect Mitchell-Carroll Custom Homes to be the signator to this Agreement.
109	Having a "shell" LLC entiity sign the Contract would be like me having my step-son sign the Contract.
109	I want the "real" balance sheet to be on the hook for meeting the contractual obligations, much like you want my personal balance sheet/income statement to be the responsible financial counterparty.
109	The other change was wording and does not effect the contract intent.
109	Talk to you soon.
110	I am interested in single family residences at Deering Bay, specifically lots.
111	What free money.
111	If you are referring to the contract, it was not enough free money.
112	Yes, I agree.
112	Remember, John has asked to go through a deal and this is a significant transaction.
112	I suggest going through the deal over lunch.
113	The only way the coal deal will go forward is if you prove you can get long term supply (pet coke, PRB, other, etc.) for $1.00-1.15/MMBtu delivered to the site.
113	The economics need to show a 8-10% IRR in order to justify the commodity risk.
113	In addition, we should explore IGCC in Florida.
113	The gas/coal spread is much larger in this market and the proforma economics would be much better.
114	Definitely attend.
115	He's solid.
116	We'll discuss when you get back.
117	Thanks Michelle.
117	Good job.
118	Why not use the actual correlations we have observed over the past 18 months.
118	Simply calculate forward gas price movement to forward power price movement (Bal 01, 02, 03, etc.)on a curve by curve basis, and you will find gas/power correlations on a forward basis are very high (80+%), at least in the Eastern markets.
119	I will only be attending the first 90 minutes of this meeting, so adjust the emission meeting to reflect that.
119	Thanks.
120	This is a classic.
120	I want to bring this guy in for an interview.
120	If he is as good as he says he is, we have to hire the guy.
120	You will get some good laughs.
121	No trading.
121	It's a NERC holiday.
122	This will be done by early next week at the the latest.
123	Another addition to the team.
124	Sounds good.
124	I talk to Tim about twice a week.
125	Add $0.50/Mwh to the off-peak component of the 7x24 price and everything else looks fine.
126	After talking with Rogers, it sounds like a conference call at 1:00 pm tommorow would be more productive.
126	Rogers and Don are still working through logistics of the move to the 6th floor and solidifying some of personnel issues.
126	Does 1:00 pm tommorow work for you?
126	We can call you from my office.
127	We have this already by comparing daily reports.
127	I simply look at the change in daily postions.
127	Both Lavo and I are OK with the current reports.
128	Done.
129	I already read this article.
129	Price action is wicked bearish on our stock right now.
129	Fortunately, I have been doing a good bit of hedging my long Enron position.
130	Is this going to get done?
130	My sense is this would reduces energy uplift charges and reduce energy clearing prices.
130	Do you agree?
131	Did Rogers sign his contract or is he still holding out?
132	I think I could make a case for decreasing ECP, because some of the uplift actually sneaks into the ECP (must run units for 6 hours etc.).
132	I would argue that the pool will dispatch more competitively when generators know that a peaker can run for 30 minutes at $100/Mwh.
132	This forces baseload units to offer very competitive pricing for all hours to ensure dispatch.
132	We have seen what the additional peakers in the East does to volatility and energy clearing prices, in general.
132	What are your thoughts?
133	Rogers will do a fine job with this group presentation.
133	I think it is important that Rogers builds credibility with the marketing organization.
133	I'm sure you are OK with this.
134	I confirmed he signed a couple weeks ago.
135	Done.
135	I'll come him today.
136	Sounds interesting.
136	Clearly, we would pay a some premium on the front end for the Boston location.
136	Work directly with Dana on the specifics.
137	I didn't receive any home information.
137	I'm interested in resale homes, new homes and lots.
137	Thanks.
138	What is the 11:00 deadline for?
138	I should be able to sign on my timeline.
139	If they are still available, I'll take them.
140	I was looking for tommorow.
140	I'll pass on tonight.
140	Thanks.
141	I agree.
142	The MTM amount needs to be gross margin, not revenues.
142	What deal was done for summer Cinergy on Friday?
142	Did Rogers sign off on all of the BECO deals?
143	We have approx 120 total seats for retail risk management on the 5th floor.
143	I think its important to put all power related retail functions (risk management, tariffs, structuring, risk reporting, etc.) on the 5th floor.
143	If you do this, then there will not be room for the retail gas group, which means you need to work with Tammy Shephard and Wes Colwell to get room on the 6th floor for retail gas.
144	Happy to do it.
145	Approved.
146	Any news on the diesel units installed at OPPD substations?
147	I think we should install 15 minute metering capability and start serving these customers physically.
147	In order to grow this business, we need to find out if we can serve retail load directly in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
147	The quicker we can achieve physical delivery capability, the quicker we can define our true cost of serving these customers.
148	Good info on new plants.
148	Lloyd - Can we get this spreadsheet on our website under fundies tab.
148	Thanks.
149	I do not use.
150	I would say 2,000,000 for Lavo approval.
150	Whether than signature, I would go through deal specifics and get verbal approval.
151	Sounds good.
151	We may want to consider diesel installation for Lincoln Electric as well.
151	I am beginning to think that diesel installations is our primary solution to cover OPPD short for May-Oct 02.
152	Fine.
153	This is the spread option which I am able to reconcile.
153	The big P&L discrepancy is on the pure TVE fixed price positions which are off by $1 million+.
153	Please continue to reconcile with Grace Kim.
153	Thanks.
154	Yes.
155	Please schedule a meeting with TJ Black (3-5800)
156	Please handle.
156	Thanks
157	Approved
158	I talked to Julie Havilend about Paine Webber keeping my on-line portfolio manager updated with all of my Enron options.
158	Entering options is tricky and I was hoping you can provide that service for me.
158	Let me know.
159	Myself and all of my desk heads will be interviewing candidates Wednesday from 1:00 to 5:00 pm.
160	Quarterly.
161	Rogers can be reached by e-mail at drherndon@aol.com.
161	He would like updates on activities everyday if possible.
161	Thanks.
162	I need approval for this ERCOT Schedule C. The e-mail from Stacey outlines the details.
162	Thanks.
163	Keep it up.
163	Our markets are getting even tighter.
164	Deny the request and the requester needs to send a formal request directly to me with solid justification.
165	Because we have lost several people to retail risk management (Rogers Herndon, Narsima Misra, Jim Homco, etc.) and John Forney has moved to ERCOT hourly, I have been forced to manage an EOL stack for multiple markets.
165	Therefore, all tours during trading hours (6:30 am to 3:30 pm) will have to be provided by non-trading personnel.
165	Sorry, but we are in our busiest season and I cannot afford to have my traders away from the desk for even 10 minutes.
166	Looks great.
167	Green Mountain prudency has been approved by Lavo.
168	Yes we are aware.
168	thanks.
169	Edison International purchased all of Com-Ed's gas and coal plants approx.
169	2 years ago and now sells the output of these plants back to Com-Ed through 2004.
169	The operators of the plant are threatening a strike and it could have huge implications with plant availability until replacement operators could be found.
169	I would like your group to closely monitor this situation and provide me daily feedback.
170	I don't agree with either 7 or 8.
170	The 0.1 LOLP generally results in 20-25% reserve margins which are excessive.
170	Reserve margin is a meaningless measure in an efficient commodity market because supply and demand adjust to price signals to keep the market in balance.
170	My view is that ICAP should be eliminated completely and, if utilized, transitional only for a 1-2 year period.
170	The other alternative is the ISO to have a reliability auction whereby quick-start units contract directly with an ISO for meeting reliability reserve reqs.
171	Several names in my Lotus Address Book that did not transfer to the new Outlook platform.
171	The names that did not transfer have text next to them.
171	For exampe, Todd Rice did not transfer and his name on Lotus Notes has "Office Number" next to it.
171	There are several other examples of this.
171	thanks.
172	Send to Lloyd Will for his review.
172	Thanks.
173	Doesn't OATI already do this?
174	I would like a consolidated report on all generation projects monitored to date.
174	My recollection was we had identified approx.
174	50-75 projects to monitor.
174	thanks.
175	How come you never show EOL #'s for East Power.
175	I would like to see East Power included in the e-mail report.
175	thanks.
176	Please handle.
176	Thanks.
177	Looks great.
177	Thanks.
178	I have not hired a replacement yet.
178	No meeting required until I find a replacement.
178	Thanks.
179	The highlights I would focus on are: 1) East Power has traded over 600 million MWh's YTD 2001 (compared to 450 million MWh's for all of 2000) 2) Averaging 350 trades per day on EOL for 2001 YTD (compared to 100 in 2000).
179	In the last two weeks, EOL daily transactions have averaged nearly 500.
179	3) Significant improvement in liquidity in all markets - EPMI now trades actively through 2005 in nearly every eastern market.
179	4) Positive P&L in every Eastern region 5) Outstanding return on VAR.
180	thanks Vince.
180	I read about this in MW Daily and on Bloomberg.
180	I think it will be a good project.
181	Will do.
181	Thanks.
182	Please put on my calender and create interview package.
183	Wow.
184	Let's bring him in for an interview.
184	Have Johnny Palmer set up.
185	As soon as I get access to crude, resid, & coal curves, I will grant access to power curves.
185	Thanks.
186	Looks fine.
187	Please have Grace (or her replacement begin including NYMEX coal, PRB 8800 Coal, Resid 1% and Resid 3% in the curve handout everyday. Thanks.
188	Please provide power curve access to Jen Fraser in EGM.
189	Please place on drive that the traders can access.
190	Good to hear from you and thanks again for the baby gift - much appreciated.
190	The family is great - Caitlin just turned 3 and Dane is now 4 months old.
190	I hope Fran and the kids are doing great - how's your new addition?
190	We will be going to Miami Sept 13-16 (Miami revenge on Washington) and hopefully we can hook up for a beer.
190	As far as the guy from Citizens - we really don't know that much about him.
190	Where is Tony Altman - under a bus somewhere?
191	Portfolio looks good.
191	Is it valuing options properly?
191	Can you rename the portfolio "Enron" Thanks.
192	I am trying to change name to "Presto - Enron" and it won't let me.
192	How do I change name?
193	Please grant Steve access
194	Thanks
195	The options are not valued properly.
195	The market value is calculated based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates the market value of the portfolio.
195	The restricted stock (basis of $0) is valued OK, but the options are not.
195	In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in the portfolio.
196	It would help me if the grant dates were listed in the Portfolio details.
196	This will help me determine if we are missing anything.
196	Thanks.
197	Did you get my message on option valuation in the portfolio?
198	Except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to me.
198	The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total market value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to get total portfolio value.
198	I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was accurate.
199	Thanks.
200	I think you forgot the cash postion.
200	I would rather have on-line valuation, even if the $'s aren't perfect.
200	I like to look at my personal equity portfolio (includes Enron hedging) separate from Enron granted stock and option value.
200	One portfolio is liquid and the other is not and I monitor differently.
201	I already signed something on this.
201	Unless I hear otherwise, I am going to ignore this e-mail.
202	Thanks.
203	We just successfully bought out of the 02 OPPD capacity and energy obligation.
203	Therefore, we don't need to proceed with the diesel installation.
203	I have instructed Terri to make your group whole on any costs incurred pursuing the diesel development in Nebraska.
203	In addition, I would like to pursue an 02 LM6000 project inside Ameren (approx. 100-150 MW).
203	This would be a strategic asset to create a control area around and utilize the flexible interconnections Ameren has with multiple systems.
203	We also have significant retail load obligations behind IP and Ameren in Illinois.
203	thanks.
204	750k is BS.
204	Ron has only been working on this for 3-4 weeks.
204	He has made one trip to Nebraska.
204	I expect more like 50-100k in costs incurred.
204	This is precisely why I told Ron to work directly with Terri on this project.
204	With respect to Ameren, Ron should work directly with me and Lloyd Will.
204	thanks.
205	It needs to look like our wholesale reports (postions shown behind each utility).
205	In addition, peak and off-peak should be on separate pages.
205	We should have two views: 1) By utility 2) By counterparty
206	Are you a mind reader.
206	I set up a once a week meeting every Monday at 4:00pm (EB641) to go through East Positions (wholesale & T&D) and discuss process, deal review, big risk items, new deals, etc. In attendance will be: Busby Don Black Rogers Herndon Jay Lewis Joe Wagner I recommend a bi-weekly meeting with the group of 6 (Belden, Presto, Lavo, Richter, Black, Herndon).
206	I will assume Kim will coordinate with the asst's to schedule time and location.
207	Make sure TJ puts on my calender.
208	Wednesday doesn't work for me.
209	OK.
209	I will have to move my weekly meeting to Tuesday.
210	Not yet.
211	Please respond to request below.
211	Thanks.
212	I understand all of those comparisons, however, the reality is if we lose Dean (which we will if we don't pay 65k + 10k), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75-80k.
212	This is pretty easy math for me.
212	I know it seems like a stretch, but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now.
212	I would like to get this done ASAP.
212	Thanks.
213	Thanks.
214	Please adjust calender.
214	Thanks.
215	thanks for the invite, but I won't be able to make it.
216	Do you have a list of people for the special trip?
216	What do you think?
216	Vegas We need to get the list of names to aviation ASAP.
217	I would support 90 MW at Homestead.
218	Could you take a crack at a draft for the Skilling/Lay presentation.
218	The presentation should focus on supply/demand (97-02), RTO progess in each region, and the progression of heat rate curves (expanded last year and compressing this year), pricing history, volatility graphs, etc. Thanks.
219	I agree.
219	We don't know the base value of the current deal, so how can we make an incremental value decision on a restructuring.
220	Mine.
220	Looks good.
220	We should get one suite as well that we can use as a beer drinking hospitality room.
220	I'll confirm dates with you later today or tommorow.
220	thanks.
221	Please put together package.
221	What is this interview for?
222	This is fine.
222	However, the Genco related info should be screened.
223	I understand and agree with everything, except 8% was the agreed upon interest rate as noted on the economic runs which establised the demand payment between my book and New Albany, LLC.
223	It is clear that 8% was the agreed upon rate and the true-up needs to be from 9% to 8%.
224	Please make a recommendation that keeps this individual.
224	I have given my views, and they are falling on deaf ears.
224	Please give me a solution that keeps the employee and saves the company money by avoiding replacement cost at 75-80k.
224	This seems like a real simple business decision and we are making it difficult.
225	Calpine is in complete disarray right now, and the entire future of their company hinges on CA honoring their long term above market contracts.
225	Calpine's non-CA portfolio is getting killed and I don't think they have hedged effectively in the non-CA locations.
225	Given these circumstances, the word "below market" is an "f" word, particulary with the legal concerns they also have.
225	I would place a low probability on getting to a value proposition that makes sense for both parties at Dighton, particularly with the legal issues.
226	Looks like Enpower is "on the side of the road" with respect to capturing and valuing retail deals.
226	As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, Plan B is a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them separately and creates postions by risk component.
226	I know this is easier said than done, but we need a tactical solution that gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct, rather than a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions.
227	I think so.
227	To top things off, there building downtown flooded and the traders are working out of there house.
227	They have no idea what there positions are, and they are trading almost exclusively on EOL from their home comWhat a joke, huh.
228	Please work with Stacey and Donny Vinson to credit New Albany LLC with the 492k.
229	I talked with Lavo and we agreed Herndon and Black should go as well.
229	I think Zufferli would make 14, but we should be able to squeeze.
229	I am calling aviation today and I plan on arranging the following: 1) Plane goes to Portland and picks up your guys at 9:00 am on Friday 6/21 (or 6/28 if more notice is required) 2) Plane picks up Houston guys at approx.
229	3:30-4:00 pm (Houston time) 3) We arrive in Cabo around 7:00 pm.
229	4) Plane returns to Houston 6:00 pm Sunday 5) Plane continues to Portland and arrives around 8:00 pm (Portland time) Let me know if this works for you guys.
230	Didn't we already hang Richter with this at the Monday mtg.
230	By the way, Lavo has indicated he will just attend our Monday meetings every couple of weeks instead of having a separate meeting.
231	No, I won't be using.
232	You caught that.
232	I guess that's fair.
232	We would likely leave around 1:00 pm CPT which would put us in Portland at 2:30 (West time).
232	Does this work?
233	We need to send someone.
233	Thanks.
234	You are 100% correct.
234	That is my impression as well, and that is why I set up the Monday meeting.
234	Going forward, the format of those meetings should be: 1) Richter presents his area of accountability (West wholesale prosition, risk systems, deal capture system, status of projects, schedule, etc.) 2) Black presents his area of accountability (deal review, west tariff, and gas) 3) Herndon presents his area of accountability (East wholesale & East tariffs) 4) Bernie presents his area of accountability (deal structuring, deal valuation, new model construction) 5) Busby presents his area of accountability (risk systems and portfolio valuation - works with Richter) 6) You and I find the holes and provide direction.
234	Your thoughts?
235	Sounds OK for now.
235	Long term, your portfolio manager should know how to value options.
236	The following people will be making the trip: Portland Houston Tim Belden Kevin Presto Mike Swerbzin Fletch Sturm Bob Badeer Dana Davis Jeff Richter Rob Benson Tom Alonzo Rogers Herndon Matt Motley Don Black Mark Fisher John Zufferli Could you please coordinate with aviation to arrange the Falcon 900 to pick up the Portland crew Friday morning with and then confirm flight details with myself and Tim Belden.
236	We may have to arrange for Don Black and Rogers Herndon to fly on commercial flight due to space limitations on the Falcon.
236	Let me know if 14 is over the limit so I can let Rogers and Don know.
236	Thanks.
237	50k.
237	Thanks.
238	Thanks.
239	A group of 14 people (West and East Power) will be taking an off-site to Cabo June 22-24.
239	We would like for you guys to join the group for a wild weekend in Mexico.
239	That's the good news.
239	Due to space limitations, we need you guys to fly commercial from Houston to Cabo (on company $'s, of course).
239	On the way back, you would fly on the company plane, and Zufferli would fly commercial directly to Calgary.
239	We plan on departing Houston on Friday 6/22 at 3:00 pm and return Sunday at approx.
239	6:00 pm.
239	Are you guys in?
239	We will have a blast.
240	You will probably be glad you didn't go.
240	If the boys are in jail in Mexico, you may have to run the desk the next week.
241	Rogers can't attend due to family conflict, therefore, you will be on the corporate jet.
241	You should be getting a copy of the flight schedule from Kim Hillis via e-mail.
242	Please make sure the meetings I need to attend are on my calender.
242	thanks.
243	No chance.
243	He gets nothing other than the pricing model through structuring.
244	Means broken and needs fixed - like your Mercedes.
245	I bet your insurance is a 3 times higher than Calgary.
246	Could I please get an updated valuation summary on the sale of New Albany.
246	Do not include the $10 million capacity unwind in the economics.
246	I want only the MTM effects (the accrual benefits are gravy).
246	Thanks.
247	done.
248	Your welcome.
249	He was under Ed Baughman until approx.
249	1 month ago.
249	He is now the Entergy/SOCO scheduler.
250	The way you set up the portfolio is very confusing.
250	Why not have two portfolios: 1) Enron - Restricted (all stock with a $0 basis in this portfolio - should be $400k+) 2) Enron - Options (all ENE stock options - gain/loss column will show intrinsic value) Thanks.
251	After setting up the portfolio, please customize the view to show the most relevant data.
251	Thanks.
252	Yes, I think we should make a formal break.
252	We have separate accountability for retail gen (wholesale plus ancillaries), and I think reg gen plus T&D should have separate accountability as well.
253	We have made great returns on the front of the curve and the back of the curve.
253	We have significant Cal 02 through Cal 05 positions, that have provided solid profitability.
253	It is completely inaccurate to say we have made all of our money on the front of the curve.
254	In addition, make sure we understand the steam obligation and it's effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate.
254	It appears the 8000 Heat Rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate.
254	Solar turbines in combined cycle (without a steam sale credit) would usually have a heat rate around 10,000 Btu/kwh.
254	The lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 24 hour steam, which means less dispatch flexibility and producing off-peak energy at a loss.
254	Make sure we are modeling these dynamics properly.
255	I am trying to customize the view and I keep getting an error.
255	Can you check into this problem.
255	I want the view for both portfolios to be: Open Date Quantity Purchase Price Last Price Cost Basis Market Value Can you make this the default view setting.
255	thanks.
256	You got it.
256	I'm learning.
256	I hope this translates in P instead of L.
257	Thanks.
258	The $5 million is strictly an internal trading #, and is irrelevant from an acct.
258	standpoint.
258	We can ignore it for the DASH.
259	Do I need to attend.
259	If so, please put on my calender.
260	Approved.
261	You have the latitude to put your key people under contract.
261	Edith was very clear when I talked to her that she wanted to transition into a marketing role where she would interact directly with customers.
262	I concur.
262	You know we are likely selling New Albany this week and I am assuming ENA's premium obligation can be terminated in the event of the sale of the asset.
263	Your kidding right?
263	What's the term?
263	Remember, I only agreed to the terms for 2001 only.
264	With respect to the flight to Ft.
264	Lauderdale on 9/13, can you see if Steve or Continental can improve our row 25 seats to a bulkhead row for both the outgoing and return flights.
264	Let me know.
264	Thanks.
265	Agreed.
266	This was not clear and the only thing I agreed to was a premium for 2001.
267	You got it.
267	I will be in Cabo this weekend with Wolfe's boss (tim belden - my counterpart in the West) and I will talk with him about their real-time trading needs and timing.
268	EPMI purchased 225 MW of Calender 03 NEPOOL ICAP (Installed Capability) from Calpine at $1.35/kW/Mo.
268	The parties agreed via a recorded phone conversation (Paul Posoli and Kevin Presto) that the LCRA lawsuit would be dropped and neither party would have any further obligations with respect to that lawsuit.
268	The parties attorneys have 48 hours to agree on lawsuit termination language, at which time the ICAP transaction becomes a binding obligation on both parties.
268	Let me know if you need anything else.
269	You didn't attach anything.
270	Joe will get promoted at year-end.
270	Associates are not eligible until 18 months of service.
270	We placed Joe in Superior.
271	Has East Power recognized the 750k refund?
272	Yes, I am very busy today.
272	I will get back with you tommorow or Friday.
273	I'm not doing this interview.
273	I told Dave Duran we have no interest, and I'm not going to waste my time on this individual.
274	Short and sweet.
274	I like it.
274	You will have to sell your competitiveness and work ethic, because you bring zero experience and your resume reflects that.
275	I will talk with Belden this weekend and I'll get back with you on next step.
276	Can you show me on an Ameren transmission map exactly where this project is.
277	Greg works for Enron North America Wholesale Services (he is Vice President in West Power over hourly trading, middle marketing, and services business).
277	You got em.
278	We don't need a floor talk.
278	I asked Tom to set up a meeting in 30C1 with origination, mid-marketing, and services.
278	This is not going to be a floor talk.
279	I would like to be able to select days, months, years, etc. for historical liquidation.
279	Somehow, we need to make the cubes or Metastock more user friendly so the traders will actually use them.
279	I have tried to use the cubes and, although the data is extremely powerful, scrolling through all the years and months is quite cumbersome and drilling down is a pain.
279	Can we somehow improve the user friendliness of these tools.
279	Thanks.
280	Find out if owners of current season tickets get grandfathered for equivalent seats in the new arena.
280	If so, I would be interested.
280	If not, I would say no.
281	I like our traditional measurment better.
281	This is good data, but is more relevant for cash traders than term traders.
282	Please coordinate with Kim Melodick to make this happen.
283	Harry is getting with Kim Melodick (HR for wholesale trading) to coordinate the transfer.
284	Doug Gilbert-Smith runs our Texas power group.
285	Yes, I will call you tonight or tomorrow to give you an update.
286	Let's bring him in for an interview.
287	Access approved.
288	Please put on calender
289	Per Lavo, he would like to see ASAP the break-even price on the reg-switch options where length was booked and when wholesale goes below tariff, we can cover and re-create free option.
289	When can we have summary valuation of this done for East positions?
290	Doesn't it become a free option if you can serve physically or reg-gen via utility tariff.
290	For example in Illinois and Ohio, wouldn't these markets create free options if the wholesale price goes below reg gen?
291	Are drinks on the house?
292	Before we book the New Albany sale, Lavo would like to have a final meeting with myself, Lavo, Louise, Stuart, and Don to go through final economics and determine appropriate booking.
292	Stuart & Don - Can you set up meeting?
293	We will pass.
294	thanks.
295	A former FPL employee (Ken Olan) will be calling you regarding a potential alternative to Orimulsion.
295	The fuel is sourced from US refinery and can be burned in the same manner as Orimulsion, creating two fuel sources.
295	Let me know.
296	Agreed.
297	I slept great.
298	Please call me as soon as we find out about the Duke board mtg results.
298	I need to know ASAP.
299	Greg, My brother is looking to make a career change from teaching (currently a biology teacher at Richland High School) into something where performance is rewarded.
299	He is an extremely hard worker who is ultra competitive.
299	Do you have any needs for entry level hourly guys?
299	I think he could learn the business quick and do well in our industry.
299	I know there is a ton of market uncertainty in the West right now with the California debacle, so I'm not sure if you need people or not.
299	Let me know if there is any chance for an interview and I can have my brother send a resume.
299	Hope everything is going well for you and your family.
299	Thanks.
300	Is the deal done.
301	I received an e-mail from Greg Wolfe.
301	They do have needs for entry level people.
301	For whatever reason, he did not receive the attached resume in my previous e-mail.
301	Please send me a final version of your resume so I can forward to Greg.
301	thanks.
302	What advantages does this bring for East and/or West Power (other than less mid-yr reviews to do)?
303	Lloyd Will is my fundies interface, and, in general, we have received very good support from Research.
304	Wow - imcompetence at its best.
305	Please give the names of the plants effected ASAP.
306	Sounds fine to me.
307	No trading on the 4th
308	Please summarize and hand out to traders.
308	In addition, create a section on our web site for enviornmental related matters.
309	As you can see, I was copied on the original e-mail.
310	Please handle.
311	My recommendation is that Berney's retail structuring group value the generation deals that are intended to serve retail load.
312	Can you believe Duke paid book value.
312	Wow!
312	They even accepted all the risk associated with the Power Systems BS.
313	Cover letter and resume from my brother are attached.
314	I think they are low in FRCC by $1.00-1.50, and I will fix tonight.
314	The GTC and FL/GA marks are good.
314	On-Peak in FRCC, however, I will be moving down some, particularly in the shoulder months starting in 03 as alot of combined cycles are added in Florida by both utilities and merchant players.
315	No problem.
315	$0.50/Mwh is enough for this service.
315	You don't need to pay a $1.00/Mwh.
315	I would say anytime she gets more that $75/Mwh, she gets a $1.00/Mwh to keep her motivated to sell at the highest price.
315	Sound OK?
316	It was actually Stuart Zisman.
317	I can speak with Chris Ahn when he gets back from his honeymoon.
318	Terry, Please set aside 30 minutes on my calender sometime next week to talk to Suzette.
318	I don't know her so your help in setting up the meeting would be appreciated.
318	Please coordinate with TJ Black (3-5800).
319	Isn't this an EOL cost?
320	Thanks for all the hard work and your efforts are greatly appreciated by the power desk.
320	Is there any chance I can talk you out of your resignation.
320	I would like you to come work for Lloyd Will and help with our services business and RTO interface initiatives.
320	We are in the process of completely revamping our systems, and your knowledge would be a huge help in pushing this initiative.
320	Your thoughts?
321	Yes.
321	His phone number is 503-464-8481.
321	I forwarded the resume and cover letter this morning, so I would wait at least one day.
322	Absolutely.
322	I may have to smooth over the Jim Mehn issue (Chris committed to go to wholesale structuring)
323	Please coordinate with my asst.
323	(TJ Black @3-5800) to set up an afternoon meeting next week.
324	Duke has indicated that the cannot complete the proposed commodity/loan transaction with my proposed collateral threshold exemption.
324	They have indicated that creates "accounting issues" for there accrual book.
324	Therefore, I need to know the cost of credit to assign to the proposed cash flows.
324	In rough numbers, we receive $200 million in the first two years and return $250 million in the last two years.
324	Because of this, in years 03 and 04, our collateral posting will be significant.
324	Let me know your thoughts ASAP on Monday morning.
325	Who is Guy?
325	I agree Rogers, however, you need to help me finesse the situation.
325	The "just say no" approach will go nowhere with Delainey.
325	Let's talk about a workable approach.
325	Hang in there.
326	Can we make sure this goes on the Web site.
327	Thanks Joe.
327	I will have Tom and/or John follow up with Rob.
328	Thanks.
329	FYI.
330	We can honor the original ticket grants.
331	Please get a $ amount from Deffner's group on the collateral cost issue.
331	Given the shape of the loan, Enron will have to post significant collateral on the 03 & 04 positions, and I need a PV cost associated with collateral requirements of this loan package.
331	Please talk with Bradford with respect to credit $'s.
332	Please assign an analyst to show all generation in the Com-Ed control area.
332	The primary owners are: 1) Edison International (former Com-Ed coal plants) 2) Com-Ed (nuclear and some GT's) 3) People's (Elwood and one other merchant plant) 4) 5-6 miscellanious merchant plants (includes Allegheny's Lincoln Center facility)
333	Thanks and good luck.
334	Who called it a new business?
335	Did you use Florida curves from Friday?
335	The curves are much lower Friday vs. Thursday.
336	Agreed.
336	Actually, I think you are being too aggressive.
337	I need the reg gen postion, transmission position, distribution position, and ancillary position.
337	If you have to bundle the T&D and ancillary into one position, that is fine.
337	However, I want the pricing assumptions for the individual pieces and our best guess for the MWh position.
337	Thanks.
338	Based on the # of EES people attending a meeting that is about tariff prices (ie. EWS , I would hate to see the expense side of the EES ledger.
339	Ridiculous.
339	I have been forwarding all of your e-mails today to Lavo and Louise.
339	I am trying to build a case to get Ader and Bernstien (Bert and Ernie are my new nicknames) re-assigned and away from our supply business.
340	Sounds good.
341	Looks good.
342	Thanks.
343	Good info.
343	Thanks.
344	No more e-mails.
344	I still don't have the forward FPC tariff curve.
344	How is this so complicated.
345	Good info.
345	Thanks.
346	When is the MISO set to go commercial?
347	What are the biggest needs in fundies right now?
347	I would like a fundies rotation, risk books, and real-time.
347	Risk books or fundies should be the 1st rotation and real-time should be the last.
348	Wes Colwell needs to create a new cost center for the new retail risk management organization.
348	My understanding is that Delainey has agreed to pay the costs for this year.
348	Please confirm with Wes.
349	You are still missing a significant grant of restricted stock in 2000 and 2001.
349	Can you please include these grants in the portfolio manager.
349	I have requested this several times now.
349	thanks.
350	No problem.
351	Lloyd and I will be assembling a team soon.
351	All discussion should go through Lloyd.
352	Yes.
353	I am still not pleased with the information display on the cubes.
353	It is way too difficult to view daily information and move from month to month to observe historical heat rate liquidations and $/Mwh price liquidations.
353	The tables on the top need to have dates and summary info.
353	Please assemble a project team to make the data more user friendly.
353	thanks.
354	We should value the project.
354	A combined cycle in Eastern NY may make sense.
355	Stuart Zisman will be your contact.
356	Yes, that's correct.
356	Sorry, but with Matthew coming back that same weekend, it just isn't going to work.
356	Have fun.
357	I need a presentation prepared for this meeting with Lay and Skilling.
357	It should be very straight forward with a demand picture by region and supply picture by region.
357	Maps with the regional reliability councils noted and overall supply/demand from 96 to 2000 should be the basis for the presentation.
357	Maps and graphs are very useful.
357	The presentation should be very macro in scope.
357	I would work with Gasill's group to make the presentations for gas and power somewhat similar.
358	The date works fine.
359	For the 25th presentation, I need the following: A pictorial description of power generation sources: 1) Nuclear 2) Coal 3) Resid Steam Unit 3) Gas Combined Cycle 4) Gas Simple Cycle 5) Hydro I would like to show annual demand by customer segment (residential, commercial, industrial) for the East, West, and ERCOT and supply by generation type for the same major areas.
359	A table which shows Mwh consumption by demand segment and generation supply by source would be useful.
359	In addition, total capability by supply source Some of this same info can be used for the 30th presentaiton.
360	As I discussed with Joe Deffner, the Duke transaction we recently completed (loan in a commodity deal), we were unable to get the "exception language" for collateral.
360	We did the transaction at LIBOR - 10bp and even when we add 65-75 bp for the cost of an LC, the transaction still provided a competitive source of cash.
360	The confirms we sent incorrectly placed the "exception language" and I am correcting that today.
361	I would like to discuss SE desk head opportunity with you.
361	I have spoken with Jim and he has given me clearance to talk with you.
361	I would like to meet this afternoon if possible.
362	Sounds good.
362	I'll see ya at 4:30.
363	I would like to discuss a term trading job in East Power.
363	I have talked with Fallon he is OK with me talking to you.
363	Do you have time to meet later today (5:30 pm) or tommorow.
364	What do you expect.
364	Enron is one of the top 25 companies in the world.
365	I am not interested.
365	Dave Duran may have interest and I will forward this e-mail to him.
366	On the new phone card (some later date), please include Rogers Herndon, Jeff Richter, Tim Belden and Anthony Dayou under retail risk management (new category on the card).
366	Thanks.
367	Please drop by to give me an update.
367	Remember we need positions broken down by component (retail gen, reg gen, ancillaries, tariff, etc.) and positions by customer.
367	We also need P&L by component and by customer.
367	Thanks.
368	I am not aware of the is RFP at all.
368	Our orig group provides zero info.
368	I will forward to Ed Baughman.
369	Who is working on this?
370	FYI.
371	I used to get an e-mail every day with the component var.
371	I would like to start receiving this again.
372	I would like hard copy executive summaries of all of the RTO orders
373	I do not agree with this approach.
373	We are so busy managing stacks which could lead to someone forgetting to inform settlements to send a termination letter which would then kill the trade.
373	I strongly object to your recommended approach.
374	The curve sheet is fine, but I totally diagree with the morning report and demand forecast.
374	I would not give these to the risk group.
375	Let's discuss this in our Monday meeting.
375	In general, though, your approach seems reasonable to me.
376	I'm good for $50.
376	You can collect next time you are in Houston.
377	I like your approach.
377	Would the Norfolk location fill the UI short as well so we could potentially get a double benefit?
378	Your welcome.
378	My wife's uncle died of Luekemia approx 2 months ago.
379	How are we precluded from extending our current contract.
379	I never agreed to that.
379	That's BS.
380	No problem.
380	I need to know by mid-week, if possible.
380	Thanks.
381	Fine.
382	None that I am aware of.
382	We need to take positions that support our long term view of competitive energy markets for all consumers.
383	You need to go through Don Black and Anthony Dayou.
384	4:30 is good.
384	Should I expect good news?
385	I'm meeting with Suarez at 4:30.
385	I can meet with you at around 5:00.
385	Sound OK.
386	Thanks for the update.
386	You are doing a great job and I appreciate you all your hard work.
386	I don't have to worry about any of the administrative issues, and that makes my job much easier.
386	Have fun on the trips and make sure you and Amy get well.
386	Thanks again.
387	Right now, all of our trades are fixed price at a specific hub.
387	We will be moving to basis markets in some locations in the very near future.
388	No problem.
388	He can expense it.
389	I need 2 additional tickets for the Washington game that are next to my 4 season tickets.
389	I will call you later today to give you my AMEX to get the parking pass and confirm the specific seat location.
389	Patrick never called me to confirm the seats in the front row of the upper section, therefore, your message is the first confirmation I have received.
389	Thanks.
390	Please put the Kinch Kato e-mail address in my address book.
390	Thanks
391	I agree with Dick.
392	Please review resume.
392	She comes highly recommended by Paul Racicot.
392	She is part of the EBS redeployment.
393	The pricing information on the website is fine.
394	No cash, but yes to the confidentiality agreement.
395	Does 5:00 work?
396	Please put on my calender.
397	Can you please add Rogers to the interview list.
397	I like Dale as a candidate to run the URM desk.
397	Given that Jay Lewis has expressed interest in moving into a marketing role under Dave & Janet, we very much need a solid sr.
397	person to run this group.
397	I understand the West is trying to get one of Jay's people to come to Portland.
397	Is Dale a candidate to run both groups?
397	If Jay leaves, we are big time short.
398	Agreed.
399	Louise indicated that credit has agreed to allow credit-worthy counterparties to trade through 2004.
399	The following are the counterparties East Power would like to have 04 access on EOL.
399	Duke BP Energy Morgan Stanley El Paso Williams Reliant Constellation Merrill Lynch Allegheny Please let me know ASAP who gets approved and when EOL will grant trading rights.
399	Thanks.
400	That is very possible because Calpine was selling 02 and 03 natty early yesterday.
401	Can you make sure and attend.
401	Thanks.
402	I have been assuming around 10k.
402	Talk to you later.
403	Stuart Zisman can answer this question.
404	Congrats.
405	Please approve access.
406	They have agreed to grant us access.
406	I granted access to power curves based on the understanding they would grant full access to all coal curves.
407	Per Gary Hickerson & Kevin McGowan, EGM agreed to make all coal curves (including PRB) available to power desk if we provided the power curves to the equity group.
407	Therefore, please ensure we receive this info in a timely manner.
407	Thanks.
408	I want our VAR to be accurate on all accounts and I will settle for nothing less.
409	Please send me the CD.
409	Thanks.
410	What is this?
411	I need until Friday to get this done.
411	This has been the busiest trading week of the year.
411	Thanks.
412	I will have TJ set up and Lloyd attend.
412	thanks.
413	Please place on calender.
414	Yes I would like to attend meeting regarding NRG deal and let's have a position meeting this afternoon at 4:00.
414	Does that work?
414	I will keep my ears open for Zone J and G markets.
414	PJM East markets are rarely shown except for summer spreads which are now $18-25/Mwh (approx.) for 02 and 03.
415	I have a fundies mtg.
415	with Skilling at 3:00 and I should be done by 4:00.
415	Let's plan on 4:00 for NRG in my office and positions meeting after at whatever location works for you.
416	Sounds good.
416	If you need anything from me, let me know.
417	Who does Janel work for now?
418	That's fine.
419	Yes we need PRB 8400 and PRB 8800 curves.
419	My agreement with EGM was coal curves in exchange for power curves.
419	Heather - If I don't get the PRB coal curves by the end of this week, I will have to remove access to our power curves.
420	Please print the agenda for myself and fax copy to Evelyn.
420	Thanks.
421	Thanks for the note and good luck.
422	I was told 2:00 pm.
423	Thanks.
424	No problem.
425	Yes, my brother.
426	I'm sure there will be a long line of requests.
426	If we have any extras, I will throw them your way.
427	I am locking up all of the hourly leads and having a discussion with them regarding there top performers and contract status this week.
427	It is becoming increasingly difficult to put non-managers under contract, so that is my challenge for the hourly group.
427	Having said that, I concur with your suggestions.
427	I am assuming you are presenting Narsima and Edith there promotion and contract packages.
427	Please confirm.
428	Glad to hear it.
429	FYI.
430	We would prefer physical rights that we can take day-ahead and/or real-time (5 minutes ahead, if possible).
430	Rather than an obligation (like FTR's), we prefer an option (spread on pricing that can only be positive when exercised).
430	I would want to condition the transaction on having one RTO in the NE with LMP pricing in effect for the entirie NE market on or before 1/1/2003.
430	Assuming we get over those hurdles, this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally (fixed cost structure), therefore, we need to earn a minimum of 25% expected return (after credit).
430	Obviously, there is a huge unknown on the CT vs. Long Island forward curve with the changing market conditions.
430	This makes pricing this deal extremely difficult, particulary with the returns we would need to show.
430	Call me with any additional questions.
431	Only if nuclear fuel storage problems persist.
431	The nuclear fleet, if unencumbered by NRC or spent fuel storage problems, will operate at 90-95% (95% during non-refueling years and 90% during re-fueling years).
431	Remember re-fuelings are now on a 24 month cycle and the next big cycle is spring and fall of 2003.
431	The 2002 re-fueling outages are actually less than normal.
432	I hear you on the liquidity Rogers.
432	With Rob making those markets effective next Monday (he is on vacation), we will find out if term liquidity is possible.
432	Please trust me on this issue.
432	You will see a significant difference within weeks, not months.
432	At a minimum, you will at least have price discovery through 2003 on calenders (they may be $3 wide in New York, but that is better than no market).
432	Keep pushing on this issue.
432	With the volatility in the NE over the past two weeks, I'm sure you understand our reluctance on term markets in these illiquid areas.
432	As far as 02 or 03 quotes for E PJM and/or NY, I have heard no markets today and neither has Dana.
432	The pool is blowing up as we speak.
433	I would pick the one with the highest return and put 100% in (most likely Stable Asset Fund)
434	They mitigated the shit out of prices (our Pepperhill project was dispatched at $300/Mwh the whole day).
435	Please review.
435	Is there a value proposition for us?
436	Rogers is meeting with Janet to sell this concept.
436	If necessary, I will follow-up.
437	If they are all in the coal group and we get all of the coal curves and transport curves, then the answer is yes.
438	Make sure we get something in writing.
438	What is the appropriation risk?
439	We still need something in writing from Janet.
440	With your retail short position in PJM, I assume we are short ICAP as well.
440	We should have your guys or Ader & Company follow-up on the 42 MW that is available.
440	Hopefully, it is in E PJM.
441	Yes, I think so.
441	He works for Duran.
441	Do you need to me to do something?
442	We liked Alton.
442	He was a very hard worker.
442	We ranked him 2 or 3.
443	Do I need to attend?
443	We should not have Fairley at this meeting.
444	Good luck John.
444	I appreciate your praise and wish you success in your future professional endeavors.
445	I think we finally have everthing.
445	Thanks.
446	How's everything going?
446	Give me a call when you get a chance.
447	Good info.
447	Thanks Billy.
448	Yes.
449	Absolutely.
449	Please call Lloyd Will to get access to our new intranet site which has an unbelievable amount of data on historical prices, loads, new gen, HDD's, CDD's, outages, etc. Our new fundies group is 100% better in terms of data quality and presentation.
450	Are we using this load now?
451	Could you please enter the following Paine Webber Account Reps into my address book (include phone & e-mail) Thanks.
452	I have book positions in the NE market and am very comfortable with our curves through 2004 in all of these markets.
452	NEPOOL came off very hard today ($2.00/Mwh through 2006) while the NY markets were off only $0.50 - $1.00/Mwh.
452	I am paying close attention to these markets given the corporate risk and I don't see any marks unreasonable given where 02 and 03 are actually trading.
452	Again - I will continue to monitor as we work toward integrating the positions.
452	Thanks.
453	Please send me a resume before I agree to any meeting.
454	I keep the curves very tightly controlled due to proprietary reasons.
454	I lose control of who has access outside my group, therefore, I have chosen to not make it available.
454	EOL has prices in all markets through 2003 which should be all you need to perform your analysis.
455	That's fine.
455	I thought we already did this.
456	Yes - Power Risk Management is more appropriate (trading is the closest to risk management)
457	We are in jail in off-peak as well and are trying to buy.
457	Most regions have markets on-line through 2003 (TVA, Ent, Cinergy, Com-ed).
457	In NY, there is zero liqidity for off-peak.
457	PJM West has pretty decent liquidity through 03.
457	I hope this helps.
458	Our marks are fine (at least through 04 where we occasionally see #'s).
458	I don't think it's appropriate to shut down anything.
458	We need to price the product properly and off-peak needs just as much margin as on-peak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth.
458	Rather than shut down products, increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market.
458	We are chipping away at our off-peak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal.
458	Am I making sense?
458	In addition, I am working with Doug to buy 7x24 from FPL in North Texas (for both desks).
458	We will probably have to pay $3.50-4.00 spread to get 3-5 year 7x24 deal done.
458	With respect to NE, the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for off-peak, therefore, in some ways the risk is easier to manage.
459	I just told Dana to get NE off-peak on-line for 02 and 03.
460	Good question.
460	We need to shift as of a specific date with fixed load obligations in the EWS retail books.
461	Could you please take care of this for me today.
461	Thanks.
462	Agreed.
463	Please handle for me ASAP.
463	Thanks.
464	Good info.
464	Consistent with reports from McGowan.
464	I am now short 02 at $39/ton and long 03-04 at $32.50/ton.
464	Love the spread given my view of natty.
464	Since the report is almost identical to info I have received from McGowan, I don't see any pressing need to call Alan.
464	You are certainly free to call him if you want.
465	I lost $2 million in new deal P&L putting the spread on because they have their curves so srewed up.
465	With respect to your question, I think the answer is yes because I can sell 02 on-line by controlling the stack (limit orders) and the coal group will sell 03-04 at $35/ton.
465	I now own this at $32 because they mis-mark their curve in 04 by $4.00/ton (ie negative $2 million in new deal P&L.) The bottom line is it was painful putting that spread on.
466	Totally agreed.
466	It is an absolute joke down there.
467	Having any luck.
467	Look at my coal markets.
468	I defer to Dana on this issue.
469	Should be Dana Davis
470	No problem.
470	I can't think of any of their employees I would want.
471	Did you check with Liz?
472	I will do Carson and Juan.
472	I am having Juan do all of his SE hourly group.
472	With respect to Forney, I will either do myself or have Doug do it.
473	Let's try the alternative.
473	Thanks.
474	By Friday, we should be above 75%.
475	Thanks alot for the info.
476	Look forward to hearing from you.
476	Thanks.
477	Williams will have weather model and research material several minutes before the general market.
477	Universities receive the data before the market and this alliance will get the weather data to Williams as if they were part of the university.
477	Any thoughts?
478	Please put in my address book.
479	Yes, Lavo and Louise are both aware.
479	This is a lateral transfer.
479	Eric will be working directly for Fletch.
480	You have the right Kevin Presto.
480	I have been employed at Enron now for almost 7 years.
480	I currently oversee the company's power trading and marketing business in the Eastern US.
480	Unfortunately, I spend entirely too much time at work, but I love the job and Enron's culture in general.
480	How are you doing?
480	I have not seen any of my Tri-City classmates in many years.
480	I think the last time I saw you was at Mark Bayless' wedding (85-86?) if my memory is correct.
480	Where is your job located and what work have you done with Enron?
481	Canes play Penn State at College Station and the natty market made a new low today.
481	Give me a call this weekend.
481	I'm taking the fellas out for drinks this afternoon.
482	Let's try to get 8 playoff tickets for the desk.
483	Please print and save for our Lake McQueeney trip.
483	We should plan a mid-September trip to New Braunfels.
484	Check to see if King or Herndon know him from their days at Dynegy.
485	I am not going to make an into-GTC market.
485	I'm going to make an on the GTC market which is significantly different.
485	I do not want to educate the market on the difference.
486	How is Brian Butler a "5" if all you have received is positive feedback?
487	Thanks.
488	With respect to Narsima, I agree with Rogers.
488	With respect to Steve Wang and Guatum Gupta, please work directly with Harry and Dana.
488	I am continuing to push responsibility down to the desk heads and that includes personnel issues.
488	Thanks.
489	I am interested in lakefront property on Lake Travis which is within 3 hour drive of Houston.
489	Given the technology sector meltdown, I am looking to "bottom fish" for lakefront property that provides great long term real estate value.
489	Please feel free to e-mail me with "value" opportunities that come up.
489	I did not find your CD-ROM user friendly and I prefer e-mails with attached property listings that meet my requirements.
489	I am looking to spend 200-250k for lakefront property that has previously sold in the 275-325k range.
489	thanks.
490	Rogers, Are we are discussing the Phoenix project at this Wednesday's meeting?
490	Is Terry going to be there?
491	Sounds like you are as busy as I am.
491	Yes, my parents still live in the same house in Kennewick.
491	My Dad retired from teaching in WA (collecting WA retirement) and has been teaching in Hermiston, OR for the last 7 years.
491	Just to clarify, Enron's international business model and North American business model are quite different.
491	I work in the Enron North American business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the US.
491	Enron NA's focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas, power, crude, pulp & paper, metals, etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function.
491	We are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs.
491	Enron's international business model, on the other hand, entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing (with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities).
491	This model is OK provided the business risk, currency risk, international risk, change in law risk, legal risk, etc. is priced properly by the debt and equity providers.
491	I will let you conclude which business model is better.
491	I think you will see Enron applying our successful NA model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a "free-market" model.
491	Later.
492	I have both days on my calender.
492	I'll get TJ to resolve.
492	Thanks.
493	Thanks Jay.
494	As usual, your position is way too logical.
494	Do I need to attend this meeting?
495	My understanding is that Shell can put them back to Calpine.
495	Remember, the deal was an all-requirements supply deal for all of Shell's retail obligations in ERCOT which are now zero.
496	I will handle the non-TVA SERC deals until John Suarez joins the group.
497	Are we sure we can live with everything else in the PJM Single RTO proposal?
498	Any interest in attending?
499	I read the proposal last night, and although it is not perfect, it is a big improvement over what we have today.
499	Therefore, I (and my team) support Enron's endorsement of the PJM Proposal (with your timeline condition).
499	Thanks for all your good work.
500	You should attend if you think you will get value from it.
501	What is the exact delivery point?
501	Does it include capacity?
501	Is it a daily call?
501	monthly call?
501	All options are quoted by Harry Arora.
502	I want only firm delivered LD offers for this position.
502	Please make this clear in our proposal and make sure the volume shape is exactly the same as our JEA obligation.
502	Thanks.
503	You've got that right.
503	I'm am short all of the power and am getting frustrated.
503	I am breaking all of the trading rules by ignoring the price action which continues to be somewhat bullish in power.
503	There seems to be very solid fixed price support at these lower levels.
503	In particular, the NE markets refuse to go down despite the fact that Benson has been a fairly aggessive seller the past two days in the 02 and 03 period.
503	For the 1st time in a couple of weeks, however, the cash market is showing signs of weakness.
503	Overall, I am very bearish and my position reflects that.
503	Like you, I have worn some curveshift the past month.
504	The source sink issue continues to be a huge thorn in our side and costs my group significant $'s every year.
504	I estimate $10-15 million per year is lost by our cash traders every year due to the inflexibility in the daily and weekly market.
504	Therefore, we should continue to fight this issue hard to rectify as soon as possible.
504	Thanks.
505	No.
506	I generally agree with your approach.
506	We may be able to assign our contracts to a competitor and actually get paid (because of margin in contract vs. current market), particularly if competition is not pricing this risk or choosing to ignore it.
506	Potential candidates are Green Mountain, New Power Co, TXU, etc. Any thoughts?
507	Fine.
507	I don't need to attend.
508	Thanks.
508	Any assignment would have to be confidential.
508	I don't view an assignment any different than the unwinds that we are currently doing directly with the customer.
508	If there is a positive NPV trade, we should do it.
508	"Assignment" maybe the wrong word.
508	Maybe we can transfer the ERCOT switching risk to another supplier or back to the customer.
509	Can you please make sure Kim Melodick attends my meeting with Jim Homco that I believe is scheduled for tommorow afternoon at 5:00 pm.
509	If Kim cannot attend, I need to move the meeting to a time when she can be there.
509	Thanks.
510	Yes, we probably can because ESCA is the vendor and we have a great relationship with them.
510	I will ask Doug and/or Forney to follow-up.
511	Please follow-up with ERCOT ISO and/or ESCA to find out if there is a technical limitation with the software.
511	Can we please get an inside opinion on the "real" issue and the "real date" so we can properly assess wholesale and retail risk as a company.
511	Doug and Rogers - Please work together on who is going to take the lead so don't have two different Enron people inquiring.
511	We may also want to consider using Tholan's intelligence group.
512	Please call me and I will give you the real story.
512	I don't want to put it in an e-mail.
513	We need to make it our responsibility so we have consistent tools applied in all of the markets.
514	This transaction was never in the trading books and all P&L and decision-making was within the origination group.
514	I may have recommended that Ozzie buy the balance of year coal, however, all $ impacts and decisions were within the control of orig/corp development.
514	Therefore, Heather, Ozzie and Don Miller are the parties that must deal with any of the contractual issues and intra-company monetary issues.
515	Sounds good.
516	Is this relevant information.
517	The average guy has no idea what is coming.
517	T&D costs are going to explode and so is wholesale power (increased O&M, security, employees, capital improvements, risk premium, etc.)
518	I'm fine with this approach.
519	Thanks.
519	Sounds like a solid no.
520	I am missing an Enron 10,000 share sale from Monday of last week.
520	The sale has not shown up in my on-line "holdings" report as it normally does.
520	I am assuming this will be corrected today.
520	Thanks.
521	Does it retain my custom profile?
522	Does this mean yes?
523	What is Zydeco?
523	No to Chinese.
524	I say we don't make any changes until we get in the new building and we will have a better feel for the vendors.
525	Please get info from Lloyd.
526	I did a spread today with Arnold: Sold 10,000 MMbtu/day of Cal 03 Bought 10,000/MMBtu/day of Cal 05 Paid $0.12/MMBtu for the spread
527	Let's discuss tommorow.
528	I talked with John today and he wanted me to remind you about the e-mail you voluntered to write regarding the transition of site profile accountability back to EES.
528	If you recall, we decided on a 2-3 month transition with some sort of drop dead accountability for all P&L risks associated with the site profile/DSM positions.
528	Do you remember this?
528	If so, John and I did not receive the e-mail.
529	What time are we meeting?
530	For files/calender.
531	Not at all.
531	Please attend.
531	However, we will need a bigger room.
531	Can you coordinate with TJ to make this happen.
531	Thanks.
532	With respect to East Power markets, I would like a fixed monthly premium in addition to the wider bid/offer in return for Refco's access to our markets.
533	thanks for the heads up.
533	I will forward this e-mail to EOL and Legal.
533	I understand his point.
534	FYI.
534	Looks like PIRA will be releasing a bearish material balance and 02 gas price outlook soon.
535	Any recommendations to correct this?
536	Please attend meetings 1 and 3 and provide meeting summaries directly to Rika for internal distribution.
536	Thanks.
537	FYI.
538	Thank you.
538	See you this Saturday at 10:00 am.
539	Christi is leading the SE RTO initiative.
539	As far as meeting, tommorow at 3:30 works for me.
539	Please confirm with TJ at 3-5800.
539	Thanks.
540	Can you please coordinate this meeting to ensure it is productive.
540	We may need an initial screening mtg.
540	to assess whether the tool can help us from a fundamental/trading standpoint.
540	Thanks.
541	I will pay $500k over the mid-curve.
541	Morgan and JEA will be your best counterparties.
541	I would proceed by showing them a bid for the shaped obligation that is flat to our mid, thus leaving you with 500k of orig value.
541	Before we show a written or verbal bid, please get approval from me.
541	Thanks.
542	Have they started construction?
542	Is the plant a peaker or combined cycle?
543	I think they are probably pricing calls vs. cancelling the project.
544	After reviewing our position in more detail, we are quite long MWH's in the NE market, therefore the 5 year 7x24 PJM East bid (100-125 MW) would be closer to $4-5/Mwh below the current mid.
544	Additional purchases above 125 MW would be discounted further for VAR and liquidity reasons.
544	With respect to Florida, I would still pay the mid for Cal 02 (shaped like JEA short) and mid minus $2.00/Mwh for 50 MW of Calender 04-05.
544	As I mentioned in the meeting, EES/EWS would also provide a bid for ICAP/ancillary services in PJM and NEPOOL where the company has existing short positions.
545	I suggest setting up a meeting with all of my desk heads after your meeting with REFCO.
545	At that point in time, you can provide an overview of the deal structure and we can talk about East Power requirements.
546	No, my understanding was we were going to give them curve access.
546	I never agreed to give them the fundies data.
547	Let's go ahead and release.
548	Please provide an analyst to support this effort.
548	This information will benefit both EWS and EES as we move toward combining the genco/control area/unit dispatch function in the new building.
548	You may want to request additional support from Jim Meyn's group, as this will ultimately effect structuring valuation.
549	How exactly are we exposed?
550	As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.
550	The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.
550	The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
550	Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.
550	At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
550	My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.
550	The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.
550	The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.
550	In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.
550	In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.
550	At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
550	Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".
550	If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx.
550	$34-36/Mwh.
550	This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.
550	Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.
550	Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.
550	Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.
550	Any thoughts?
551	They are pursuing because I requested to pursue.
551	The reason for the e-mail is to place management emphasis on this opportunity.
552	Could you please make sure this is on my calender and ensure that Jeff Keenan and Dave Duran are also aware of this meeting.
552	Thanks.
553	Thanks for the info Mike.
553	Our real-time market is a complete piece everywhere ($10-18/Mwh).
553	Generators are beginning to puke MW again.
554	My management book is going to take this $1.45 million hit
555	The loss is part of the $1.45 million.
555	The loss occurred due to generator repairs.
556	FYI.
557	I talked to him this morning and feels comfortable with his marks.
557	He is long, so he better.
557	Like I told you yesterday, I wouldn't hesitate to to be more aggressive on the front in ERCOT, particularly in the North where Doug is long.
557	I'll keep you posted.
558	Looks like Ader & Co. at work in ERCOT.
558	I view this as a big problem.
558	These customers need to be covered by wholesale.
558	Both of you should take this as a slap in the face.
559	We are losing lots of deals in ERCOT on price.
559	This is part of the reason they are being so aggressive with customers and alternative suppliers.
559	I have received this feedback directly from Rogers and Janet.
560	Make sure Rogers is at this meeting.
561	Full access of the complete portal should be limited to core contract employees only.
561	We have a scaled down version that we have made available to the marketing group.
562	I bought 10,000 MMbtu/day of Cal 04 NYMEX NG at 3.315 and 3.32 from Arnold this afternoon.
563	Excellent update Mike.
563	We have good momentum with some key "players" on the ropes.
563	I view the next two months as critical in moving the Midwest to one functional market.
564	I am getting more like you every day.
564	Given what's going on in EES right now, I don't trust anyone.
564	Therefore, I am going to allow access to the portal to only EWS employees that you are comfortable with.
564	Obviously, this includes Dale.
564	With respect to the rest of the EES group, I am not going to grant access until the entire organization is doing the right thing for Enron's shareholders.
565	Please grant full access to Dale Furrow in retail risk management.
565	Dale is a VP under contract and is a key member of the retail risk management staff.
565	With respect to the URM employees under Dale, please grant them the more limited access.
565	With respect to the EES employees (Ozzie, Beth, Greg Woulfe), I do not want any access granted at all.
566	No interest.
567	How many days do I have left?
568	Please follow-up with this guy.
568	Looks like a retail load aggregator looking for wholesale supply.
569	Please send an e-mail to "Experience Enron" and let them know the tours need to be conducted as far away from the trading floor as possible and limited to no longer than 5 minutes.
569	I don't want any of our screens visible to the customers, not matter who they are.
569	Thanks.
570	I have been getting lots of requests from our friends.
570	I'm just giving you a heads up.
570	I have no problem with the URM group, unless, of course, they become part of EES.
571	You are right.
571	They are on crack.
571	This would be at least $3.50/Mwh over Cin.
571	They have gas deliverability issues in the winter and there alternative fuel is No. 2 oil.
571	Therefore, CPL East is a big premium Nov-Mar.
571	The bid/offer for this location is large due to transmission risk.
572	I will attend only if the whole group is represented (gas, oil, west power, and east power).
572	Once we have confirmation for all relevant parties, please let me know.
573	You can count me in. We can have 3 hours of EES bashing.
573	Thanks.
574	Please provide my asst.
574	(TJ Black @ 3-5800) with meeting time and location.
575	Your thoughts on this guy for SE cash and/or term spread trader?
576	John, What about Eric Benke?
576	Did you review his resume?
577	Late afternoon.
577	Have Fletch and myself interview.
577	He has already been in here for one interview.
578	Do these look reasonable.
578	What are the costs charged to fundies?
578	The allocations are confusing to me.
579	I am having Lloyd Will review.
580	Sold 150 contracts per month of Feb-Mar 02 at 2.81 Sold 50 contracts per month of Nov-Dec 02 at 3.24.
580	Bought Cal 06 at 3.60.
581	Please coordinate with Kay to set up a time that works for both of us.
581	5:00 pm tomorrow is good.
582	I told TJ to coordinate with you.
582	5:00 pm is fine tommorow.
582	Please confirm with TJ.
583	I have a conflict on my calender.
583	I can meet at 3:00 only on Thursday and will be out on Friday.
584	We'll see.
585	Lakes on Eldridge subdivision: 5410 Morning Breeze
586	As a follow-up to our meeting on Saturday, I talked with the designer of my house (Todd Rice with Rice Residential Design) and the electrical plan is not on a CAD system.
586	The electrical plan was hand drawn.
586	If you need a copy of the plan, my preference is that you deal directly with Todd and his staff as I am very busy during the week.
586	Todd Rice Rice Residential Design 11111 Katy Freeway
587	I don't like the 2nd bullet - not positive enough.
587	We are the dominant player in the power market.
587	With respect to volumes for term trades, the risk group will have to provide that to you.
587	I can tell you that the volumes have increased in the term market by a significant factor (at least 10 times relative to last year).
588	This has not been booked.
588	I was told Q4.
588	What is this?
589	Sounds like he might fit in the LMP/transmission/congestion management group.
589	As I mentioned, we are attempting to create an Eastern Interconnect LMP model to model congestion in every region.
589	This will lead to the creation of hubs and basis markets.
589	Ravi might be a good fit for this group.
590	We are already completely full.
590	In fact, we are already 2 seats short for my own group.
591	Thanks for the info Heather.
591	In terms of forward curve, Entergy is the worst place to be long assets right now.
591	The equipment is probably of more interest as it relates to a packaged development for the Midway project in Florida.
592	Please provide me with the latest hard copy so I can have one final meeting with my direct reports to get final confirmation for East Power seating.
592	Thanks.
593	Please make the following revisions to the peak and off-peak position reports: Remove ERCOT wind position completely from the report (PPA has been terminated) Add ERCOT north zone positions Add ERCOT south zone positions Show separate positions for FL/GA border and FPL/FRCC Add PJM-East positions (show separate from PJM-West) Off-Peak position still shows SERC-FL (this location no longer exists) - Florida positions are either FL/GA or FPL/FRCC.
593	Thanks.
594	Let's sit down and talk.
594	I think we should fill from within our current desk.
594	I have some ideas.
595	roundtable meeting.
596	Do we have 4 or 8?
597	Ask him if Scherer 1,2,3 and/or 4 would work?
597	Let him know that an odd lot would command a $2.50-3.00/Mwh premium on top In addition, even if we used Scherer, it would be from any one of the facilities therefore the transmission would need to be able to use any of the Scherer units as a source.
598	There should be no credit on a TVA/Cin spread.
598	The correlation between the 2 markets is 95% plus.
599	Will he let us go hourly at least 5 times per month and change the source if we go hourly.
599	This essentially would require they provide parking and lending for up 20 MW in the Cal and 40 MW in the June-Sept.
599	Can we at least get a 50 MW block in the June-Sept period?
600	Please put on my calender.
601	He is a definite hire.
601	I thought I communicated that last week.
602	I did not realize we were going to reserve on spreads which create zero net position and almost zero credit risk.
602	The new forward correlations are 90+% per the var model and it looks like your credit model is still using the old correlations.
603	I would like ASAP (by new building) a huge wall map with the logical RTO boundaries that has all of the large generators and substations (nodes in LMP) and LSE's territory color coded.
603	This will become the tour location with a description of the regional markets and the energy hubs within those super regions.
603	It will also help our traders get accustomed to electrically significant areas whether than NERC regions.
604	Good luck.
605	We need the hourly option to allow for non-GTC sources, but we will deliver into-GTC border hourly.
606	We don't need gas at this point, but we should be planning to add this.
607	Notice on the tags when we go hourly could be 30 minutes or less.
607	Additionally, if we use them as sink when we go hourly, they will have to be part of the day-ahead tag.
607	If these issues are not crystal clear with them, I have no interest in even showing an offer.
608	Are all of these units in our database?
609	Please follow-up with this gentleman.
609	Never know.
610	I need to leave at 3:30 today to go to my stepson's football game.
610	Unfortunately, I have a 2:00 and 3:00 meeting already.
610	Is this just a general catch-up discussion?
611	What time works for you guys?
612	Florida might be a better location than New Jersey.
612	Can you say sunshine?
613	OK.
614	He's making his rounds.
614	I believe he is talking with Corp Risk and Reck.
614	I get the impression he doen't want to be anywhere near an energy commodity that has a relationship with power (which, of course, is all of them)
615	No.
616	Please participate and give group overview.
616	Thanks.
617	I'm $2 bid for this spread in Cal 02.
618	Thanks.
619	From East Power's perspective, the East PJM development site is the only site/turbine of interest and we should pursue pending transmission analysis to ensure the site is within the congested area of East PJM.
620	Outstanding.
620	As usual, you are the king.
621	What other offer?
622	I would support this 100%.
622	It is consistent with the direction that Whalley, Lavo, and Delainey are headed with the retail risk management group.
623	Do you know this gentleman.
623	Suarez is high on him.
624	Resume looks impressive.
624	We should definitely interview him.
624	I forwarded e-mail to Louise to see if she knows the guy from her London gas trading days.
625	I give bankruptcy 50/50.
626	We'll go after him.
627	TJ has my calender.
627	Just about any afternoon will work with this group.
628	I'll pay the extra $'s.
628	I would like No. 480 in the new garage.
629	We need an immediate legal review to see what are on-going $ risks are in ERCOT.
629	The deficiency of $6500 is no big deal when they allocate to all of the QSE's on a pro-rata basis, however what if the deficiency is $100 million and we our pro-rata share is $3 million?
629	Do we have any legal recourse?
629	Do they suspend the deficient QSE immediat|
630	Why can't we use AEP's position against them in their own backyard (Ohio).
630	AEP's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without real-time energy markets (which I agree with), yet there is no real-time energy market with ancillary clearing prices in AEP's service territory in OhioCan we use their own testimony against them?
631	Rika and Lloyd.
631	This is work in progress with a realistic completion date of May 2002.
632	I don't understand this e-mail.
633	Can you please set up a meeting and we can discuss.
634	PM call with the whole group, including Suarez.
634	Can you find a date that works for everyone.
635	Looks fine.
636	Ader has managed to get cross-wise with another good employee.
636	Ader's "supply group" has essentially stolen Roger's approved ERCOT LSE accounts.
636	Rogers needs these LSE accounts to serve load in ERCOT and now he has none.
636	This is BS and should not be tolerated.
637	I talked to Giffels today and he mentioned that SONGS units are under serious security scrutiny given its location.
637	He gave us a 50/50 probability that Indian Pt 1&2 (30 minutes north of NY City) and Pilgrim (15 minutes north of Boston) would be shut down in the near term for security reasons.
637	He mentioned that SONGS was also a candidate.
637	I personally don't think the probability is that high, nonetheless, the rumors seem to be in the market.
638	Thank you very much for the nice gift (and, of course, the $1).
638	I appreciate you girls putting up with me and doing a great job for the whole floor.
638	Thanks again.
639	I told TJ the phone interview needs to be in the afternoon.
639	No way will 11:45 work.
639	We need a 4 or 5:00 pm phone interview, preferably tommorow.
639	Can you please coordinate with TJ.
639	58 SOCO trades yesterday.
639	5 already this morning.
640	They have over 2500 MW at Wansley over 2 coal plants and 4 gas turbines (in CC).
640	They can offer LD at this location
641	I am interested in firm LD fixed price energy delivered at the Gannon bus-bar.
641	I have no appetite for unit contingent in the current market.
641	TECO has an entire system they can lean on.
641	I would consider bringing the gas, but you would have to involve Scott Neal's desk for transport and valuation becomes complicated.
641	With respect to volume, I would not want any more than 100 MW.
641	My strong preference is fixed price energy - no toll.
641	Volatility is getting smashed and it doesn't make sense to pay for vol in a spread option.
641	We are a much better bid for 5x16 or 7x24 energy.
642	My phone interviews are complete.
642	Please send someone to pick up my forms.
643	Garret Tripp would be better able to answer your questions for the Canada nuclear facilities.
643	With respect to forward hedging in the US, we have never seen British Energy hedge anything.
643	I believe they have transition contracts with the utilities they purchased the plants from.
644	The meeting has been moved to tommorow at 11:00 am.
644	We can discuss these issues before the meeting.
645	I will show him a 50 MW block.
646	I want to make sure the info is protected and if legal and regulatory are comfortable, then I am.
647	Probably Andy Fastow.
647	His personal hurdle rate is 29%
648	No.
649	No problem.
649	The only problem right now is ENE's stock price.
649	Wow - you get em.
650	We have some serious issues.
650	Downgrade, collateral called, liquidity crisis, issue more equity.
650	I can see $12 pretty easy.
650	I think both Lay and Fastow are gone.
651	Do you know this guy?
652	Have HGP attend.
653	Get him in the door.
653	Work with Kim Melodick in HR to make it happen.
654	Looks fine.
654	You need to start learning.
654	Work with Kim.
655	I have sent the message again to make curves as accurate as possible through 2015.
655	We are doing are best.
655	The Entergy situation was simply a back office mistake.
655	The NY off-peak is a work in progress and will get better every day.
655	The legs never trade, only the cals, therefore, we have to use common sense for month values.
655	Thanks for the info.
655	In most cases, Narsima is exactly right.
656	I agree with this approach and I'm fine with this allocation.
656	My objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination.
656	I caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 4 hour tolls vs. 8 hour tolls vs. 16 hour and I could tell there was a disconnect.
656	thanks.
657	Are we making sure everything is done on our end to liquidate and manage the EES retail positions effective 1/1/02.
658	Probably Wayne Herndon.
658	We need to lock him down ASAP.
658	You and I need to have a beer this week to discuss ENE in general and what you want to do next.
659	Let's go tonight.
659	I have a staff mtg.
659	at 4:00 pm and we can go after that.
659	Does this work for you?
660	Please proceed with Stacey on taking the prudency you are comfortable with.
660	Stacey will have to get approval from Louise and/or Lavo.
660	Thanks.
661	No need to copy trading.
661	Thanks.
662	We can't make a daily capacity market in the current environment.
663	As of 11:15 am, East Power has sold approx.
663	600-700 gas contracts and bought approx.
663	3 million Mwh's.
664	Just Morgan Stanley requiring tighter credit terms so far.
665	Jeff Shorter (your counterpart at TXU) just called me to inform me they will not be trading with Enron until further notice.
665	They are evalutating their net exposure with us, including London.
665	His number is 214-875-9632.
666	I would have interest if you package together 50-100 MW of these small units to create a more liquid block of power.
667	I would not pay alot for this given the transmission issue.
667	The best place for park and lend is JEA.
668	We need to do what the contract says.
668	No one knows what the real intent was.
669	See you Monday.
670	Please attend.
671	We are not to discuss credit issues with any counterparties.
672	I'll defer to you and Lloyd on this one.
673	It's the trader's option.
673	Most will probably not attend.
674	The time is right in the middle of trading on an AGA day.
674	Therefore, it is unlikely that anyone managing a stack will be able to attend.
674	I would suggest having Tom May and/or Lloyd attend.
675	Agreed.
675	As far as I'm concerned, we are arbing the market.
676	No. We buy and sell where we see value.
676	We don't even look at the other exchanges.
677	I would treat it as business as usual.
677	If we are still having Associate/Analyst Super Saturday, we certainly can attend an energy panel discussion.
678	Can I get a deal like that for my house.
678	Wow!
678	I'll be here until about 2:30 today.
679	Wednesday is the worst day due to AGA.
679	We normally trade until 4:00 pm on AGA days.
679	Therefore, I would suggest Tuesday or Thursday.
680	Please have Mark call me at work today.
680	My phone # is 713-853-5035.
681	Thank you.
681	Is the black cover going to be removed so other employees know the spot is reserved?
682	We have a meeting with Evans Automation next Saturday 11/10 at 10:30 am (near Kemah).
682	Please mark the calender.
682	Thanks.
683	Posoli Work Phone: 713-830-8663
684	Very efficient CC gas units in Entergy and ERCOT are setting price.
684	Midwest and Plains has gas setting price 4-6 hours per day and coal the remaining 10 hours.
684	The NE markets (NY and NEPOOL) are the only markets with 10,000 HR gas units setting price across the entire peak.
684	Keep in mind that current temps are truly "no load" temps for East power (no heating or cooling demand).
684	The addition of new combined cycle units in our market have been destructive to forward heat rates.
684	Later.
685	I'm fine with it.
685	They will only see through Cal 03 though.
686	Please set up a time with my asst.
686	to discuss job opportunities in East Power.
686	Bring a hard copy of your resume.
687	Make sure we are crystal clear on being able to fill this position physically at any VEPCO interface (hourly or day-ahead), and the PJM/VEPCO PJM LMP index is for pricing only.
688	The LD should be the hourly index.
689	The LD calc should be the hourly index and we need to eliminate the Peak Day designation damages.
690	Dana is interested in talking to JT about a scheduling and/or hourly job.
691	I will buy 5x16 unit contingent power $3.50/Mwh below my curve for 02 only for into JEA delivery.
691	I will buy firm LD at my mid for into JEA delivery
692	My preference is normal energy only LD language.
692	If we agree to use an index pricing point (like PJM/VEPCO interface), then a fair trade-off is to eliminate the capacity ratchet.
693	None of the meetings
694	No interest.
695	Please e-mail me the latest East Power Org Chart (including services and Genco).
695	Thanks.
696	We plan to be done trading at 1:00 pm on Friday.
697	Thanks Joe.
697	It was a pleasure having you as part of the team.
697	I respect you as a person and a professional and I wish you nothing but the best in your future career.
697	Please stay in touch with the team.
697	Good luck Joe.
698	I apologize for my earlier comments.
698	Everyone is having a rough time with the current meltdown of the company.
698	I have been here 7 years and I am seeing everything I worked for coming to an end.
698	It's not your fault and I do apologize.
699	Agreed.
700	I sold 5,000 MMBtu/day of Cal 04 NYMEX at 3.79/MMBtu.
701	The hourly index is a must for me (the day-ahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 10 years).
701	It is important to understand that under the new proposed structure, VEPCO will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge.
701	I will not due this deal based on a day-ahead index - it must be hourly at the interface we defined.
701	Please clarify your call option vs. firm delivery comment.
702	We will not be trading on Thanksgiving.
702	However, we will have a skeleton crew in here on Friday.
702	I proposed calcing P&L on Wednesday and not on Friday.
703	What do you mean only the left side.
704	What a piece of shit this whole BTU market is.
704	Your mid-offer spreads look very reasonable to me.
705	Yes.
706	Fine.
707	Agreed.
707	I think Bradford already blew up the Constellation deal.
708	Thanks.
708	Sounds like you are having a blast.
708	See ya on Sunday.
708	How about them Canes.
709	The old lady says no.
709	So far, there is 5 power guys that will play if the game is on.
710	No interest in pursuing this business.
711	Any value in this?
712	I'm supposed to be in Disneyworld with the family for my first vacation in two years.
712	Sorry, but I can't swing it.
713	I usually do, but she's been holding out.
714	Please attend.
715	I have received
716	Yes, authorized.
716	Thanks.
717	I am not approving any new Kobra applications.
718	This is a test.
719	This is the retail book, not the wholesale book.
719	You can get confirmation on this issue from Bill Bradford or Elizabeth Sager.
720	Enjoy your holiday.
720	Hopefully, we will be up and running by the New Year.
721	Could you please create an org chart by function (retained employees) and org chart by function (severed employees) so we can reconcile to make sure we have not missed anyone.
721	Once we have done this, we can create a seating plan that is optimal.
721	Please e-mail me the org.
721	charts so I have an electronic version.
721	Thanks.
722	Please kill this request.
722	I get 4 everyday.
723	Thanks.
723	That will work fine with me.
724	The only issue I have is everytime I login I have some Windows Installer program I have to kill and it takes me an extra 2-3 minutes to keep closing files before I can get into my desktop.
724	I don't know what caused this, but I am assuming some file you installed is still trying to run.
724	In addition, the dial-up through Citrix is very very slow.
724	Is this normal?
724	Any thoughts?
724	Thanks for all your work - the printer works just fine
725	Your thoughts on this guy?
726	Please stop sending me this report.
727	OK - Tim did say he blew up trading options in the West.
727	Played the "premium is profit" game selling summer calls at Palo Verde and we all know what happened.
727	Bye Bye Ricky.
728	You are very welcome.
728	You have been a fantastic asst for me and could not have achieved what we have as a group without you.
728	Thanks again for all of your hard work and have a Very Happy Holidays!
729	I cancelled this over 4 months ago.
729	Someone might have assumed by terminal.
730	Please send me a summary.
730	Thanks.
731	Olgethorpe has officially terminated as of Dec. 20, 2001.
731	Please see attached.
732	Wisconsin's offer is a joke.
732	Carl - This is is clearly a two-way termination or they would have no offer at all (I'm assuming you understand the difference).
732	We can buy Cal-02 Com-Ed under $30/Mwh all day long.
732	This is a position we will deliver on to preserve the in-the money value.
732	I would make it clear to Wisconsin that we intend on delivering in January and every single month thereafter because it creates positive cash flow for the estate.
732	We also have broker quotes that show the market is 28 at 29 for Cal 02.
732	I would accept nothing less than $1.2 million.
732	Thanks.
733	175k/yr.
733	Wow - you get em.
734	Don, This looks good.
734	You have my blessing to proceed with approval from the cash committee.
734	You can reach me at home (713-856-7483) if you have any additional questions.
734	Thanks.
735	Obviously, we will not deliver (or receive if we are long) if the transaction would result in negative cash flow for the estate on a "net counterparty" basis.
735	Therefore, FE and TXU obligations would not be met for the 1st week of January because they result in negative cash flow.
735	Cory, Please make sure going forward that we only include positive cash flow counterparties in the weekly projections.
735	Please exclude the TXU and FE positions from the net position report as well.
735	We will likely begin filling the non-pool positions starting next Wednesday.
735	Jason - Please send to Cory (I was unable to from home)
736	See note below.
736	Upon confirmation from Portz, please remove Wabash from the non-termination counterparty list.
737	I believe Wabash has also terminated.
737	Don, As you know, we had a meeting like this the week prior to Christmas and had an accurate list at that time.
737	Our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred.
737	I think the meeting is warranted, however, we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues.
737	I will see you on Wednesday at 2:00 pm.
738	Please keep Rogers contact info for his vacation.
738	Thanks.
739	The attached document should complement the documents sent earlier by Chris Calger.
739	Hopefully, the combination of the two will provide some organization and focus at our 9:30 am meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the "NETCO" Start-up initiatives.
740	The same attachment was sent again in case you had trouble opening the previous file.
740	I am sending from home via the network and have been having some problems.
740	Sorry to e-mail you to death.
741	Please put on my calender and remind everyone on Wednesday.
741	Thanks.
742	FYI.
743	Attached is the spreadsheet version of the template we discussed this morning.
743	I have added the additional columns everyone requested.
743	I would now like the business unit leads to fill in the blanks such that we have an initial Power Implementation Plan that can be delivered to Louise on Friday.
743	With respect to East Power (I am out Thursday and Friday), I am delegating to all of my desk heads the responsibility the following: 1) Have all of the forms attached spreadsheet forms complete 2) A product offering sheet is added to the template.
743	Fletch & Dana - Please take the lead on creating the product offering list (physical and financial).
743	My recommendation is we put products out through 03 for all regions (financial and physical).
743	Obviously, the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license.
743	Cory and Don Baughman - Please take a crack at identifying all of the transmission service agreements we need for the East (Christi has started a list already).
743	Please call me on my cell (713-856-3923) with any questions.
744	FYI - trumped already.
745	Please send this attachment to the same list I just provided.
745	thanks.
746	Please get final version to Tammie by COB tommorow.
746	thanks.
747	Maybe.
747	If we truly believe this is a credit starved industry with huge liquidity problems, then we should be able to dictate the terms for dealing with a AA entity........
747	end of story.
747	We should send this message early and often.
747	If we don't, the market will percieve that negotiating "one-off" terms for trading docs is acceptable.
747	I disagree with this approach from a long term philosophical standpoint.
747	We either believe our bullshit or we don't.
748	Attached are Dana's additions.
749	Please print a copy of each for me.
750	Yes.
751	Please incorporate Dana's changes into the Master.
752	Do you already have this list.
752	Please send all templates to Chris Calger, Elizabeth Sager, and Mitch Robinson.
752	thanks.
753	All East Traders will have East only trading rights except for me.
753	With respect to regions, assume the same organization as we ended with in early November.
753	The one change is Rogers in the SE along with Suarez, and Carson.
753	MW - Fletch, Russell, and Jason SE - Rogers, Suarez, Carson NE - Dana, Benson, Gupta, Broderick, Thomas (off-peak), Misra, Rogers, Makkai, Step, Schneider Remember, all of the desk heads will have gas trading authority as well.
753	None of the prompt month cash traders will be trading gas.
754	I want to make sure we get the hardware and software (I agree that this is already the property of ENA) into Netco like we have the rest of the software/hardware critical to the trading organization.
754	The payable is sunk and should be left with the estate.
755	Whoever has the latest aggregated Implementation Template, please forward copy (copies) to TJ so I can review the consolidated lists for: Regulatory Trading Agreements Transmission Service Agreements EOL Products TJ - Please follow-up to make sure I get the latest version.
755	Thanks.
756	Please save and print for me.
757	Please print and save file for me.
758	Christi Nicolay and Sarah Novosel are the two best regulatory people.
758	In terms of pushing the timing, political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from Kean and Lay.
758	Obviously, that will not work anymore.
758	I have a good relationship with Larcamp (FERC head of Staff) and might be able to help with the politics.
758	I think FERC is going to want to hear directly from the new owner.
758	If we want speed, I recommend we use the expertise of Christi and Sarah combined with the overall political clout of the new owner.
758	You are not off base with Steffes at all.
759	shapiro is a lazier version of Steffes.
760	I concur with Jim on approach with one clarification.
760	Transmission providers discussions should include both a trading rep and marketing rep.
761	Same as Chris.
762	Do you want me to put docs in front of Harry, Rogers, and/or Doug?
763	Thanks Chris.
763	I agree with the approach.
763	It would be nice to handout a bound copy to all of the East and West trading/marketing desk heads for a thorough review to make sure we have not missed anything.
763	See you tommorow.
764	Please cancel out the short and long KM position in the Holdings section.
764	thanks.
765	Please begin scrubbing the 02 and 03 new gen book again given the current situation in the energy market.
765	I would like a new forecast in 30 days if possible.
765	In addition, I would like begin running the unit commitment model (dispatch) and "knock" the cob webs off everyone.
765	Let's plan on having a meeting to go over what the new daily reports were going to look like - wasn't Gus working on this?
765	What is the status of the transmission modeling?
765	Can we integrate the system dispatch and LMP simulation models?
766	Thanks.
767	Yes, that would be fine.
767	I would also like to talk about my fixed annual fee.
767	Based on the way I trade, and the amount of asset accumulaton, I think my fee is too high.
767	Please call me about this issue so we can discuss.
768	OK.
769	Joe Holmes from IdaCorp (208-318-2100) called and expressed interest in Enron's services deals in the NA, presumably in the West.
769	Don - can you have someone follow-up.
769	thanks.
770	Can I hire Martin Lin back into Netco from the estate.
770	He has provided valuable transmission & dispatch modeling expertise to our fundies group (he worked for Vince in Research).
770	We have lost Anna Santucci to CMS and this would not change our headcount in the fundies group.
770	Additionally, if I was forced to cut additional bodies, most of the cuts would likely come from real-time (3), options (2), regional trading (2), logiFor Martin's planning purposes, I need to know something ASAP.
770	Thanks.
771	Don't worry christi - I recognize what a great job your group did this year.
771	It was by far the best regulatory effort (from a power perspective) with more results than any of the previous 7 years I was at Enron.
771	You and your team deserve a great deal of credit and if we can keep this team together, we will reap the benefits for years to come.
772	The ESCA energy management system (EMS) in an industry standard software package to provide control area services and energy accounting in compliance with NERC standards.
772	We used the software and hardware for remotely controlling/operating/dispatching our peaker plants and also used the software in 3rd party "outsourcing/services" deals in ERCOT and SPP.
772	I hope this helps.
773	See changes attached with one subtraction (Joe Step) and one addition (Doug Gilbert-Smith).
774	I just sent you the promotion justifications.
774	After further thought, Maria Valdez should be promoted to CS Manager, not Commercial manager.
775	Does Nat's organization look OK.
775	Looks OK to me.
776	I have done multiple trades today and I also did several last week.
776	Please clean up my Holdings page to net longs and shorts.
776	How is your office reacting to the news about UBS acquiring our energy trading operation?
776	thanks.
777	I run the power group.
777	Your question should be directed to Lavo.
778	This is crazy.
778	We should not be giving the fundy web data to the estate.
779	Please use the next week to clean up our database of delivery locations and regions currently still in Enpower.
779	I would like to start the database clean with only the key hubs listed: NY Zone J NY Zone G NY Zone A Ontario PJM East Hub PJM West Hub PJM West ERCOT South (FP) ERCOT North (Basis) Let's use this opportunity to clean up Enpower and start with a truly clean set of books.
779	Team - Am I missing anthing?
780	King, Carson, Suarez, Gupta, Broderick, Schiavone, Misra, Wang, and Ballato also need to be able to trade gas (or there equivalent trading books need to be able to trade gas if the above names change).
781	The UBSW Energy on-line products should be limited to the locations below through 2003 only.
781	Off-Peak markets will be only in NY, PJM, NEPOOL, and ERCOT.
781	NY Zone J (FP and Basis) NY Zone G NY Zone A Ontario (FP and Basis) PJM East Hub (FP and Basis) PJM West Hub PJM West (Basis) Com-Ed (FP and Basis) TVA (FP and Basis) Entergy (FP and Basis) ERCOT South (FP) ERCOT North (Basis) Casey - Please see above the markets that will be Fixed Price (1-30 day market) and Basis/Spread (forwards).
782	I view the sharing of the fundies databases and associated web sites (gas and power) with the Estate as a serious commercial issue that we should not ignore.
782	The estate can not only use the proprietary information as a competitor in the trading business, but they could potentially sell the data to multiple competitors.
782	I can't imagine that this data was agreed to be shared by UBS and the Estate.
782	I am not planning on giving any of the data to the Estate.
782	I feel very strongly about this issue and the rest of the commercial organization does as well.
782	One of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in this business is our huge headstart in this area.
783	I would like to recommend to following allocations of retention $'s - THIS CREATES NO NET IMPACT ON TOTAL $'S ON THE SPREADSHEET Gain 575 cash 450 equity (Rogers Herndon, John Forney, Joe Wagner, Tom May) Re-allocate in the following manner: Cash Equity Steffes +50k +50k (we will lose key reg people if we don't pay) Please call with any questions.
783	I feel very good about keeping nearly all of these people at the levels above and we could lose some key ones if we don't do this.
783	Again, I am not spending any additional $'s - I am simply taking from other people who will not be part of UBS.
784	See request below.
785	I think I can get Jeff King done with a simple title change from Associate Director to Director with no salary change.
785	His current salary is already Director level type comp.
785	I potentially may need another 25k, but the title is a "feel good" issue that is important to Jeff.
785	Please talk to Doug directly on the justification.
786	My Holdings page is still not netting.
786	I just purchased 5000 DYN shares - please make sure the netting works.
787	thanks for the heads up.
788	This is Mirant's argument.
788	Don't think it will hold water, but you never know.
789	I support this.
789	This wan an oversight on our part.
790	Remove.
791	I understand.
791	If I have too, I will dip into my money.
791	I think the requests are reasonable and fair with respect to individual's peer group.
792	Carson is done and I just talked with Suarez.
792	I told John he needs to make his decision based on the economics in his package.
792	150/150 is a great package for Suarez.
792	I would be uncomfortable increasing based on other areas where we may be short.
792	Good news on Craw.
793	Thanks Rogers.
793	I think Steve would fit in with our group well.
793	I probably need to wait at least a week to let the dust settle on our own people issues.
793	My guess is we will end up losing 2-3 people and outside candidates then become viable.
794	Please put Allan Stewart Contact information (get from Rogers) in My Outlook contacts - home, cell, work, address, etc. and put a reminder on my calender to call him to re-establish contract relationship.
794	Also, please put a reminder to call Fred Giffels regarding consulting agreement and FPL.
795	Are we going to attend?
796	Fine with me if Hunter and Lavo can support it.
797	I want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions.
797	I think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint.
797	I want to be able to represent to employees that "lawyering" the docs to death is not necessary, because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees.
797	I would like an affirmative yes on this question by Tuesday am.
797	Does everyone agree?
798	Agreed.
799	please put on my calender.
800	Please put Steve Marland's Cell number in my Address Book.
801	Come see me tommorow morning.
802	Please put on calender and remind all desk heads to invite people who have signed up.
802	This includes you, Tina, and Claudia.
803	I don't have this finalized yet until final personnel decisions are done.
804	I vote No. 1.
804	I think the necessary synergies between gas and power marketing in TX can be accomplished at you and Milly's level.
805	test
806	Ryan is waffling.
806	I talked to him this weekend and he said his wife wants to move back north.
806	These weather guys need physcology treatement.
806	Dave now thinks this UBS deal is full of risk.
806	I think the Friday event has everyone freaked out.
806	Sorry to ruin your Sunday evening.
806	With respect to fundies, I already have my guys working on this.
807	Please call me when you get in to discuss hole in SE.
807	thanks.
808	Ron Green is the President of FPL Energy and Mark Maisto is the President of FPL Energy Trading (sub of FPL Energy).
808	I have Mark's contact info at home.
808	Send me an e-mail at kmpresto@hotmail.com and I can reply at home with his contact info.
808	You would be a great fit for their shop.
809	Don't know his capabilities well enough to make an accurate assessment.
810	Please send the updated org list to Calger.
810	thanks.
811	Lloyd Will will send to you today.
812	Please net longs and shorts for DIA and DYN.
812	I will do almost all trades on-line, therefore, I would like some mechanism to make all trades net on the Holdings page.
813	I'm fine with it.
814	FYI.
814	Please coordinate with Hunter and Belden on what we need.
815	Fletch Sturm (works for me and runs the MW power group) will be following up with you or Allen.
815	We need to make sure we coordinate with gas and west power so no duplication is occurring.
815	We need to also make sure that UBS is not already a client who receives PIRA materials.
816	Can we enter a retainer agreement with Sarah at Bracewell and have her attend this meeting on our behalf.
816	Jim - What is your budget for this year on outside services?
817	1.
817	Lloyd can trade any region with 30 day limit and total position limit of 100 MW.
817	Lloyd will do mostly spread trades.
817	2.
817	Per our earlier discussion 3.
817	Ontario is part of the NE and we plan on having an Ontario market maker.
817	I have to sort this out with Milly.
817	Please stay silent on this one until we get the deal closed.
818	Please print and put in green binder.
818	Thanks.
819	Harry is out.
819	We are not extending an employment at will offer.
819	Please destroy the contract offer and "drafted" employee at will offer.
820	Casey Evans has all of this.
821	One group needs to mark curves.
821	I personally think it is easier for us to mark curves because we have traders in every region.
821	I simply need to make it a priority again.
821	I can go either way, though.
821	We definitely don't want two sets of curves.
821	Let me know.
822	I think you are probably correct.
822	Upon closure, you will probably be marking your own curves.
822	Having said that, you should probably begin now.
823	Make sure this gets all of your attention and is done right.
823	I think we also need retail capability in ERCOT.
824	We need all historical data preserved in all markets (price, vol, trades by counterparty, volume by counterparty, broker vs. EOL, broker prices, EOL prices, etc.)
825	We need it w/in the first 30 days.
826	Please complete Hayden's form for your respective regions.
826	Keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form.
826	In addition, UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L.
826	The "liquidity reserve" accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid (offer).
826	Thanks.
827	OK - Doug can have Smith Day and Jeff Miller work to get the retail certification.
828	I think this guy should be independent from the fundies.
828	There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, Hunter, Tim and myself.
828	I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role.
828	Other input?
829	Through separate desktop.
830	Yes - coordinate time with TJ Black.
831	Please remind me to file expense report from CT trip.
831	In addition, please block my calender from Feb 6th to 10th for Florida (Miami) vacation.
831	Please also change the March vacation to March 9-13 (Disneyworld).
832	I agree with Rogers.
832	Because only one entity can mark curves and I have once again made this a requirement for all traders to get re-acquainted with value in the market, it makes sense for Netco/UBS to mark curves until the cutover occurs.
832	At that point, both entities will assume separate responsibility.
833	Still no fix.
834	This is all wrong - Amy has latest list.
835	This list is wrong.
835	Can you reconcile our headcount by functional group with this "incorrect" headcount.
836	Please put in contact book.
837	Based on what Fletch and Doug are doing, I would increase your #'s significantly.
837	Your liquidity data is very conservative compared to Fletch and Doug.
837	Your forward volumes are approx.
837	20% of Doug and Fletch and your ST data is about 50%.
837	I would complete the form based on the liquidity we saw in Aug and Sept.
838	Yes, Wang and Stalford picked this back up yesterday.
839	I agree with the delegation except for Chris Dorland.
839	Tim Belden needs to determine who validates the West Power curves.
839	With respect to vol curves, Steve Wang and Rob Stalford need to validate.
839	What time period are we validating?
840	There is one left - Net 10000 DYN short with 10000 DYN long.
841	My guys are telling me that all of the broker sheets we collected are now in your hands.
841	The validation for East Power should be very easy because we collected broker quotes almost every day and marked curves nearly every day.
841	If there are gaps, please let me know.
841	With respect to vol curves, I am having Wang and Stalford go back and validate.
842	Gas or Power?
842	Gas is Scott Neal and Power is Doug Gilbert-Smith for ERCOT (TX) and Fletch Sturm for LA/AL (Gulf Coast).
842	The Williams energy traders know these folks so these questions must be coming from non-commodity people at Williams.
843	Please put Russell's info in my contacts.
844	Pushkar and Ellen Su are not SE Power offers.
844	They are offers for our interest rate books/FX books.
844	They should not fall under Power headcount.
845	Casey has a list of all the East Power curves.
845	Frank - Stop re-inventing the wheel.
845	This stuff has been done already.
846	I will be in town Monday and Tuesday.
846	Out Wed-Fri in Florida.
846	I will definitely help on Monday and/or Tuesday.
846	I can make arrangements for backups later in the week if necessary.
846	Let me know.
847	When will we close?
848	Did UBS waive the employee CP?
849	I have already moved someone from ERCOT to SE Power.
849	We are set.
850	Please print and put in green folder (ignore redlined version)
851	Chemistry is very important to me and I am rewarding Carson for his loyalty and "low maintenance".
851	In addition, he demonstrated much improved risk management skills that last 6 months of last year.
851	Mike (working for Fletch) is very capable and will do a great job for us in the SE.
851	Eric Saibi will come over from ERCOT and run the cash books in the SE.
851	I will be happy to talk Marcello to see if there is another fit.
851	With respect to the NE, I also want to move some of the young guys up - they have worked hard for the past 12-18 months in real-time and fundies roles and deserve a chance before an outside person.
852	Obviously, coordination with gas and power fundies (rika imai and chris gaskill) is important for almost all projects unless confidentiality is necessary given the nature of the project scope.
852	My view is No. 1 is part of Rika's core day to day world.
852	No. 2 and No. 4 are more special project in nature and this is a gap you could help fill.
852	I will be out Wednesday through Friday so we should sit down tomorrow.
853	I sit at 06543 (will be moving Wednesday/Thursday).
853	I can meet mid-morning tommorow.
853	Get on my calender with TJ at 35800.
853	thanks.
854	Please ensure that real-time prices for ERCOT, PJM, NY, and NEPOOL are added to the cube database.
854	I have been analyzing the data today and the real-time clearing prices are not there.
854	Thanks.
855	What about DIS
856	What do you need from me?
856	Do you want me to meet with him?
856	talk to him on the phone?
856	go to lunch?
856	is he looking for a job?
856	As you can see, I don't have much information of the objective here.
857	These are not good fills.
857	When I gave the order DIS was trading at 21.87 (21.86 at 21.88).
857	I can understand 2-3 cents but not 9 cents.
858	Lloyd - Don't worry about the formatting.
858	After playing around some more, I have a new way that works fine for me.
858	The main issue is keeping the database live with all of the historical information.
858	We can figure out how to format.
858	thanks.
859	I received your voice mail and I'm OK with electronic signatures.
859	However, for the 1st 60 days, I still want to review.
859	thanks.
860	Go ahead and run with it.
861	Go ahead and cancel.
862	I believe he has signed.
862	Confirm with Dana Davis.
863	Please print and put in binder for me.
863	Please combine the document from yesterday in the same binder so I can read the whole package while I'm on vacation.
863	Thanks.
864	Can he come over to our trading floor around 11:00 am?
864	I can give him a quick tour and then give him a macro overview of the NA energy markets.
864	Please confirm via e-mail and directly with my asst.
864	(TJ Black at 713-853-5800).
864	Thanks.
865	Please arrange a room for an East Power Mtg at 10:00 am this morning.
865	Agenda: UBS Warburg Energy Closing/Implementation On-line products (which products and when) Power documents (EEI and ISDA)
866	The whole group.
866	Please type the short agenda I have prepared.
866	Thanks.
867	I won't be in until about 9:30 because I have to get my drug test done.
868	Did this meeting get confirmed?
869	Did you submit my expenses from the CT trip?
870	Andy can trade all regions and all commodities (just like a desk head).
870	He is replacing Harry.
871	Can we update the laminated card with the most recent headcount and phone #'s.?
872	Is this the office I selected?
872	Please confirm.
873	I will be out Wednesday through Friday on vacation.
873	Please have Dana Davis, Fletch Sturm, Rob Benson, Andy Zipper, and Doug Gilbert-Smith represent East Power in my absense.
873	Thanks.
874	Jim, Please provide a quick update.
874	I was unable to participate in your call today because of a market risk mtg.
874	with UBS.
874	I will be out Wednesday through Friday so I would like to hear directly from you what FERC's state of mind was.
875	Filing looks good.
875	My vote is go forward with a clean 205 filing as attached.
875	If we file the 203 as well, FERC will gravitate directly toward that.
875	I think we retain more flexibility if we stick with the 205 approach.
875	Other thoughts?
875	I will be in Florida (vacation) Wednesday through Friday.
875	I can be reached via cell and TJ will have my hotel phone #.
875	In addition, I will check e-mails at least once per day at the hotel business center.
876	I can be reached on my cell in Florida.
876	In addition, you can leave messages with the hotel voice mail (I am staying at Ritz Carlton on Key Biscayne).
876	I will also be checking e-mail at least once per day.
877	Please increase my H:/drive limit.
877	As Managing Director for East Power I require the ability to retain more than 500MB.
877	Please contact Lloyd WIll at 713-853-3383 if you require any additional information.
877	Thanks.
878	Your thoughts?
879	If I picked 6102, why am I getting 6103?
880	Please make copies for me and put in a folder.
880	thanks.
881	Can you figure out a way to get my new card without be being there.
882	I received zero.
883	6103 is on the original e-mail from tammy shephard.
884	I'll get back with you on this within a couple of days.
884	Do you want an indicative bid for 7x24 bus-bar energy (2, 5 and 10 years).
884	We would not bid on the entire 1000 MW - maybe 150-200 MW.
884	thanks for the info.

721	Concerning ProLiance, we have tried in the recent past to negotiate with much difficulty a Master Gas Purchase Sale Agreement with this customer.
721	There are significant credit and legal issues surrounding ProLiance.
721	Enron Credit has refused to grant a line of credit as a result of these issues and will not ok a GISB.
721	In addition, ProLiance has proven to be most unreasonable with regards to terms in the Master.
721	Please give Russell Diamond or I a call if you have any questions and or comments about ProLiance.
722	As requested, please see the attached GISB draft for your review.
723	Further to our conversation here is the GISB draft for your review.

733	Regarding Section 1.2, ENA perfers the "Oral Procedure" which as noted in Section 1.2 on page two is considered a "writing" and to have been "signed".
733	For all transactions under the GISB, a written confirmation will be sent by ENA notwithstanding the choice "Oral" on the first page.

903	Regarding BC Utility, I have discussed a GISB with Mr. Wong and we have been unable to come to agreement due to their choice of law restriction.
903	Because they are a utility they are by statute required to bind agreements subject to British Columbia.
903	Conversely as this would be an agreement subject to state laws of Texas as well as the United States, it will not work to agree to British Columbia as jurisdiction for this contract.
903	Please let me know if you have any questions, or I can be of further assistance.
904	With regards to our discussion on priority of contracts for 30 day firm transactions.
904	The system gives priority to Master Agreements over GISBs.
904	All things equal, a 30 day firm transaction will attach to the master before the GISB.
904	Hope this helps.
905	Marcia, Thank you for your e-mail regarding SP's to the purposed GISB.
905	My responses are as follows: Section 1.
905	We will agree to your suggest language.
905	Netting: We suggest the following: In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount shall pay to the other party the difference between the amounts owed.
905	Adequate Assurance: We will agree to 5 business days.
905	Term: For firm delivery limit the use of the GISB to 30 days.
905	For interruptible delivery there is no limit.
905	We will agree to the above along with our other SP's as written.

0	I am so sorry about Jack.
0	It is very difficult for me to accept that he is gone.
0	He was a very special man to me as I was growing up.
0	Jack was as much like an Uncle to me as any of my blood relatives.
0	He always represented the pillar of strength while still being able to to be one of the most loving and compassionate people I have ever known.
0	To me Jack was everything a man was supposed to be.
0	It always made me proud to talk to Jack about my football games and later on the oil and gas business.
0	It was neat that in a way I was following a similiar path in life to the one that Jack had taken.
0	And when my daughter was born I began to see how he must of felt about his three wonderful daughters, who I still consider to be like sisters to me.
0	I was so excited when Little Jack was born this year because I knew how proud and excited he must have been to finally have his boy.
0	I hope someday I have the opportunity to tell him what a special man his Grandpa was.
0	The thing I always will remember about Jack was that when he walked into a room, he filled it up, not because of his size, but because of his enormous personality and lust for life.
0	He could always put a smile on your face.
0	The world has lost a very special man.
0	I know this is hard for you and the girls.
0	It is hard for me to write this without breaking up.
0	I Love you guys and wish I was there with you.
0	Love Mark Whitt
1	I don't know why it did not go.
1	It was huge!
1	He called it within 15 yds.
1	and took it with a bow.
1	We missed you in Jackson!
1	Weather was great, so was the fishing.
2	How is the little one?
2	I'm sorry I missed the date!
3	How much does Logan weigh?
3	Does he stand a chance against his brothers?
4	Updated
5	Please find the attached draft version of our proposed gas supply structure.
5	We have focused on minimizing your fixed charges while still giving you the right to call on up to 30,000 mmbtu/d of Firm Cheyenne supplies.
5	In addition, Enron will manage your transportation and imbalances associated with your PSCO transportation contracts.
5	Obviously we will need to see those contracts prior to finalizing this transaction in order to assure we can meet those obligations.
5	In addition, I am sure we will need to "tweak" this proposal to meet you physical requirements (volumes, terms etc.) Please give me a call once you have had a chance to review the attached.
5	Mark Whitt
6	Please find the attached Firm Contract
7	please add tbutt@pioneeroil-co.com
8	Brian, After talking to our legal department it seems that in order to effectuate the wellhead purchase we will need assignment of the Williams contract instead of being agent.
8	This is important because we will have title to the gas at Durango.
8	Therefore we need to have the contract assigned to us.
8	Can you talk to Williams ASAP and see if that is a problem?
8	Thanks Mark
9	Please find the attached.
10	Theresa Staab and I would like to come to Houston on Monday and spend some time with you and Jason on Tuesday.
10	We need to discuss some specifics on the purchase proposal such as how you want each netback to be determined, logistics and documentation.
10	Let me know what time would work for you on Tuesday.
10	We probably need a fair amount of time.
10	Tyrell and I are working on a monetization structure for your gathering system.
10	Can you tell me if the Oil and Gas Division was able to keep the gains associated with the rollout of the hedges?
10	We think we might have a structure worth looking at.
10	P.S.
10	Dan and I would like to call you on Friday in regards to the Ft Union capacity.
10	Some time in the afternoon.
11	Please review and share your comments and concerns.
12	Let's talk it through.
13	Discuss with Stephanie and Barry.
14	I would let her know that there is no definite timeline but we are closing a transaction next week.
15	Heidi, Please sum up my costs and Paul's cost for this trip and forward to Barry.
15	Barry, All of the Hotel costs were on my credit card, so all Paul should have is his airfare and incidentals.
15	But we will sum it up for you.
16	I like those kinds of schedules!
17	I suggest that you build a boxing ring in the back yard!
17	Let's try to get together soon.
17	Sounds like we have both been too busy!
18	I made a few small changes
19	That is great!
20	The attached can act as a starting point for discussions around Enron's purchase of Pioneer's Powder River Basin Methane supplies.
20	Once you have reviewed it please give me a call at 303-575-6473 and we can discuss it.
21	Not suprising!
22	Bud Cranford
23	That should keep you busy!
24	Can we get this?
25	Let's Plan on watching this.
26	Please look at this.
26	I didn't know how deep to go with the desk.
26	Do you think this works.
27	This is the contract # on El Paso if you need it.
28	Let's take this injto consideration for Kennedy's Recluse gas.
28	Let's get a proposal from Grasslands and we can put together a summary of the options for Kennedy.
29	Laine could you add Jay to your email distribution list?
29	His address is jay.reitmeyer@enron.com
30	Please include the following language: If both parties agree, the CIG Index portion of the pricing can be changed during the term of the contract to reflect other market and transport opportunities.
31	This is all I have
32	Could you have someone draft an interruptible purchase agreement for Pioneer Oil.
32	I will forward you the address.
33	Here is an opportunity to get a box for one of the games.
33	Detroit on Feb 4th would be great!
33	That is a Monday.
33	If you and Kim wanted to you could come up and ski that weekend prior.
33	Let me know what you think.
34	Please put together your vacation schedules for the rest of the year and forward to Heidi by 10/25/01.
34	Heidi, please organize these into one summary and let me see them before they go to Barry.
35	The only thing we need to make sure we are covered on is all the Huber purchases in the Powder River will be starting on Dec 1.
35	They could be quite involved.
35	So let's make sure we are ready, especially if you are out.
36	Those dates are fine.
36	Of course I am sending this to you on the morning of the 19th so maybe you are already here.
36	I will be your contact.
36	We are at 1200 17th St. Suite 2750.
36	the office is in the process of being subdivided so it will be easiest if you come by and I show you what we are doing.
36	Call me if you need anything at 303-575-6473.
37	The following customers are currently covered by Fred Lagrasta's middle market desk primarily for derivative transactions.
37	In all cases except for Hallwood, ENA Denver has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business, we would like to expand that business to cover their Derivative business as well.
37	The list is based on priority.
37	We would be willing to cover them for their West Gas business only.
37	Fred could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business.
37	Xcel Energy (PSCo) and affiliate e Prime.
37	Devon Energy Cross Timbers Hallwood Energy Forest Oil Prima Patina Oil and Gas Westport
38	No problem
39	I can show you what the difference is between Cheyenne Hub daily prices and CIG first of the month index prices, but that is kind of like apples and oranges.
39	To clarify, you do not have to buy on Enron Online (EOL), we can quote you physical prices over the phone and you can use EOL for price discovery.
39	You do not have to decide that now.
39	My recommendation is the attached: Major changes are: Price - Gas Daily Cheyenne Midpoint plus $.05 Demand Charge- $6,000 per month In addition.
39	Enron will provide market based pricing for additional volumes above 20,000 mmbtu All of this is of course subject to negotiation of the appropriate contracts and Enron's review of the PSCo transportation contract.
39	Let me know what you think.
40	I wish I was that smart!
41	I only added one line, otherwise it looks good.
42	Let's set something up for monday
43	ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.
43	Their "angle" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.
43	As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.
43	ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.
43	Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.
43	The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.
43	There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this "retail" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.
43	However, they seem to have some political backing.
43	These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts: 1.
43	Power Marketing and Project development 2.
43	Gas Supplies and Pipeline access 3.
43	Regulatory and Transmission expertise Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.
43	Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.
43	Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.
43	I don't want to make this email a novel!
43	Thanks a lot.
44	No changes to mine.
45	What time are you meeting today?
45	Do you want me to participate?
46	We are going to do a month to month interupptible purchase agreement with Patina Oil and Gas.
46	The gas will be delivered into Lost Creek.
46	The price will be Gas Daily Cig Midpoint index flat.
46	The flows will vary daily depending upon well production.
46	I am not sure if we have an interruptible purchase agreement with Kennedyl Did Paul ask you to put together a wellhead purchase for Huber in the Powder River Basin?
47	Plain vanilla intervention is fine.
48	Would Nov. 1 or 2 work for either of you?
48	Email me your fax number and I will fax you a copy of what the developers have given me.
48	Thanks
49	I have to go to the management meeting in San Antonio on the afternoon of the 14th.
49	Would it be possible to meet in Denver on the morning of the 14th?
50	What is your fax number?
50	I will send you the project summary.
51	It works for me.
51	Steve, would that be possible for you?
52	Brian, I propose that we use the attached contracts for the bridge between our two term deals.
52	Mark
53	These are draft versions of the interruptible purchase agreement and confirm for your gas into Fort Union.
53	Think about what you what to do for term, volume etc. We will then add in the gathering charges.
53	We are pretty flexible, so let me know what works for Patina.
53	Thanks, Mark
54	Sue, Just wanted to let you know that we filed comments in support of Xcel's ability to manage price risk and be incentivized to do so.
54	If you have questions about our comments, give me a call.
54	Thanks, Mark
55	I would like to see you get on the Denver 1/2 day schedule.
55	Any 12 hours you choose from 6:00 A. M. to 8:00 P.M.
56	No I am delerious because I am too poor to eat.
56	It should be Lost Creek.
57	I told Alicia that she and the kids are eating way too much!
57	She told me that her Oils business is really taking off!
57	I think she may need to start turning tricks!
58	I will start to get you some good ones.
59	Can we meet next Tuesday on October 30th?
59	Afternoon is prefferable.
60	Could you check this out?
60	It should be on my Mastercard
61	We are reviewing the security tapes today.
61	The tape doesn't lie!
62	May have to reschedule until the end of next week to bring Bruce to Houston.
62	What does Thurs/Friday of next week look like.
63	Reminds of the old TLC days.
64	Worsley, you might even be able to find a woman with this kind of service.
64	Or if you prefer I hear they have some cute goats.
65	I won't be available from2:00 to 2:45 mountain time
66	I bought in today I think that we are very near the bottom.
66	Mid-teens has to be a good buy.
66	Famous last words!
67	You scare me!
68	Don't tell her I sent you this.
69	This is still rough, but it is a little better.
70	Haven't heard form you in awhile.
70	Thought you might find this funny.
71	What are the cost per trade?
72	Actually I don't have your number.
73	I forwarded them our comments and characterized them as being supportive.
74	Really well.
74	We are probably going to have another meeting on the 30th of October.
74	Jake Thomas and Steve Walton are going to attend.
75	Either time is good.
75	How long do you need.
76	Please check inot this
77	That seems really high!
77	What can we do to lower that?
78	Anytime.
79	I didn't think you ever wore a bra!
80	Can you find out wha the average rental income is on one like this?
81	Are they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?
81	Or is Williams going to take the risk?
81	I wonder why Entergy is taking space?
82	I am never big on utility guys.
82	This guy seems to be very focused on Sumas compared to U.S. supplies.
82	I think he is a want to be trader who got out of hand at a utility.
83	I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.
83	They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.
83	I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.
83	I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.
83	However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.
83	Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality.
83	Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.
83	I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.
83	Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.
83	If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.
83	Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion.
83	In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.
83	Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.
84	The meeting will be around 1:00.
84	Just come to our office at 1200 17th St. Suite 2750.
84	Then we will go over to Crestone office.
84	I anticipate that the meeting will last about an hour to an hour and half.
84	Mark
85	I don't have a problem with it.
85	I think he would be as good or better of a trader as some of the "kids" I have seen down there losing $30 MM.
85	At least he has some concept of the physical market and how it works.
85	I would think to get the best value he would have to be located in Houston for that role.
85	Especially if Steve wants to "pick his brains".
86	Can you see what this is and how we approve it?
86	Thanks
87	Not Bad
88	Barry it looks reasonable to me.
88	I sure would like to add something sizable to the totals for Q4.
88	But I'm a pig that way!
89	I can't believe they are going to stop the employees from managing their investments through such a turbulent time.
89	This will be a case study in how not to do things.
90	I am ready when you are.
91	Let's discuss
92	Please Review and let's discuss next steps.
92	I would like to have the physical guys you met recently give this the smell test.
93	I can't pull up.
94	I will be out the 19th but should be in the 20th.
94	Amy Felling should be your contact on the 19th.
94	She is most familiar with our computer systems.
94	The Enron North America offices are at 1200 17th St. Suite 2750 in Downtown Denver.
94	The office is over 9,000 Square Feet but is currently under construction in order to sublease approximately half of that space.
94	We currently have 6 employees.
94	I believe that you have copied all of the Enron offices that I know of.
94	The only other potential office is EOTT.
94	Let me know if you need anything else.
95	I have to do a presentation on Spark Spreads for NOv 8th.
95	I need your help putting it together and probably running the presentation for me.
95	This may have some good info.
96	Let's get a new product.
97	I think they will struggle to get the 175 MM/d.
97	Have you heard anybody else contemplating taking space on Western Frontier?
98	Look at the weekly strategy product for producers.
98	Let's see what one of these will look like for our customers.
99	That sounds good.
100	We are probably more interested in people who have more experience in the Western U.S. Preferably direct producer relationships and Rocky Mountain Utilities and Industrials.
100	We don't do any trading in the Denver office.
100	Thanks for the lead though.
101	Is this your final version?
101	If not, we need the final so we can get fundies to set up the updates.
102	Thanks for coming to Denver for the meeting.
102	I know it seems like a longshot but if it happens I think we have an excellent shot at being involved in some respect.
102	Thanks again.
102	Mark
103	That sports email was great!
104	Are you saying that the U.S. Producers are hedging their Canadian Production with U.S. counterparties as opposed to Canadian counterparties?
104	Or are the decisions being made in the U.S. and executed in Canada?
105	Just wanted to let you know how Brian was responding.
106	We decide to leave out the $ value in order to focus them on the structure.
106	I do not see the conversation about option values on the pipe?
107	Enron North America does transactions with the following companies which may be considered Enron Affiliates: Crestone Energy Ventures Bear Paw Energy Lost Creek Gas Gathering All three companies are primarily gas gathering companies.
108	I had not heard that there was a discussion today.
108	However, since we ran the economics for Huber and discovered that Enron's books do not appropriately value the Permian capacity, we have been trying to convince BP that the value of the capacity is greater than the basis spread becase of the optionality associated with the variable costs of fuel and commodity.
108	We used to have a model that the transport group used to use to value that optionality based upon the volatility of the basis spreads and the variable costs.
108	Steph and Phil are running numbers to determine Enron's "extrinsic value".
108	We need to discuss how and what information we share with BP in order to convince them that the capacity is worth more than the value than that the outright basis markets .
109	Brian is showing up at our office at 5:00.
109	We will be there soon after.
110	You know that ENA sold our pipeline assets to Northern Border Partners in Q3 of 2001.
110	That is what became Crestone.
110	The list I gave you is of who we do business with now.
111	We usually see mostly regional basis deals out of our office.
111	Especially with the bigger guys.
111	We do some Nymex trades for our smaller producers.
111	It seems the big guys use their banks for most of their basis.
111	Thanks for the info.
112	You gotta see yhis!
112	Pass it on to other WGR alumni.
113	Make sure you read all the way through to Enron.
114	FYI guys
115	Please review the attached
116	It's pretty scary!
116	Shows the state of the industry, doesn't it?
117	We have a very good relationship, and long term gas sale with Thermo Partners who manage the 270 MW Ft.
117	Lupton facility.
117	They have inquired as to Enron's interest in either buying the energy, tolling or buying the entire plant.
117	The effective date would be July 2002.
117	The plant is currently under a QF contract with PSCo.
117	Mike, I would like to see if you have some time on Monday afternoon to discuss the particulars and we can devise a game plan to get you connected with these guys.
117	Let me know your availability.
117	Thanks Mark
118	That gave us a good chuckle this morning.
119	These are the new days for the management conference.
120	I made one change.
121	Let's talk about logisitcs and your ability to manage your kids schedules with being gone from 7:00 to 6:00 everyday.
122	I have changed the dates and prices in these agreements, but those should be the only changes necessary.
122	Let me know if either of you see any other changes that are necessary.
122	Brian, let's get together this afternoon and see if we can organize our other capacity release transactions that need to be completed by December 1.
122	Does 3:00 your time work?
123	Sorry
124	let's talk about this today at 3:30.
125	Can you come in on friday for interviews?
125	Sometime around mid-morning is probably best.
125	Let me know.
126	How is it going?
126	I was just checking in to see where you stood on the selection of your gas supplies.
127	Plan on a couple of hours.
127	I am not sure about lunch.
127	I may already have plans.
128	Let me knowif there is anything else you need from us.
129	Sounds like we are still in the hunt.
130	Thanks for the update, we will coordinate with Jason while you are out.
130	As you evaluate the latest proposal, I understand that Huber may have credit concerns with Enron given all the rumors that are circulating.
130	You know we are confident we will straighten things out soon.
130	However, please understand that we are willing to do what is necessary to make Huber comfortable (Pre-pay, Letter of credit etc).
130	If you have any questions just give me a call.
131	FYI.
131	I told them we will address any credit concerns they may have.
132	I thought we discussed LC's and Prepays the other day and they were both options?
133	FYI, for what it is worth, I spoke with Bryan Hassler today and he said "that everyone he has talked to" (Reliant, Sempra etc.) had told him that the market is very slow right now.
133	For whatever that is worth.
134	Do you have an estimate for the cost for the Christmas Party?
134	Dow you want to split it pro-rata based upon headcount?
135	You can bill us afterwords.
136	I knew I could count on your support.
137	Did you see what happened today?
137	We dropped to $7 but rebounded on rumors of a merger to $9.
138	I'm sure it is sad.
138	This is a lesson for those of us who are younger.
138	DIVERSIFY!
139	Isn't it crazy!
139	I just have a hard time believing it is real.
139	What have you been up to?
140	I didn't know you were living in an apartment.
140	When did this happen.
140	What do you mean repair or rebuild?
140	I hate to hear about you and Nadine.
140	That is too bad.
140	Didn't she know you were a piece of shit when she married you!
140	I hate that these women forget that we have always been shitty.
140	The kids are great!
140	Brock is finally becoming alot more fun.
140	He and Lauren get along really well.
140	Too hard to tell what will happen with Dynegy.
140	Not sure I want to work for this new regime.
140	I guess it all comes down to money.
140	As always I'm still a whore.
141	Please add Jeff to the daily email.
142	Wow, I didn't know that you got flooded!
142	That's awful.
142	I hate to see that you and Nadine have deteriorated to that point, but if it is over you just have to keep your head up and move on.
142	If it was me, I think I would start looking for one of those Russian Mail Order brides.
142	It will cost you a plane ticket and some braces but you won't have to buy a boob job because they all have great tits!
142	You can't be getting fat.
142	Aren't you still running?
142	If not you need to start.
142	If not for your body do it for your mind.
142	It is the best thing for that!
143	This is sad, don't let him know I forwarded it to you.
144	Please add David Pozner to our distribution.
145	Please email David Pozner a 10 yr.
145	curve by yr.
145	for the following: Northwest Rockies
146	FYI We are planning on joining Crestone for a combined Denver Christmas party.
146	The cost for our share will be approximately $1,000.
146	I know it is not cheap, but I think it is an important signal and morale booster which is critical at this time.
146	We have a long way to go in this deal.
147	We would love to have you and Kim.
147	Might even be some snow by then.
147	Just let me know if you can make it so they can get a good head count.
148	Have you heard anything from the HR lawyers regarding our ability to fire her in the near future for poor performance?
149	The following is a summary of the estimated costs of our buildout/subdivide project: Blueprints $6,000 Construction $70,000 Furniture $3,000 *Commisions were negotiated by Enron Realty We had a profit of roughly $70,000 on the sublease over the term of the lease and will save approximately $11,000 per month on the sublease.
150	The Crestone guys ar the Map guys.
150	Really it is just WIC, CIG and Williams
151	Am I right about the WIC, CIG and Williams?
152	December 14th.
152	Friday Please join us.
153	This is what we discussed with Heidi a few months ago.
154	It's up to Paul Miller
155	This guy used to work for me, He is really strong on finance and analytics and structuring.
156	Here are our credit ratings vs. our competitors
157	Take this advice in the new year.
158	We are doing a gag gift exchange.
158	Usually it is pretty good, so try and bring something.
159	Lucci reccomends www.matchmaker.com and www.russianbrides.com.

160	Did you see Tim?
161	Have you heard from FUGG on Enserco?
162	This is an old one but still good.

163	Shamu Club.

163	Nadine comes to our house today.

165	As always you are the consumate proffesional.

167	Are you sending out Xmas cards.
167	We usually do, and we usually send a small $25 gift to our best customers (ones we make money off) and those who do operational favors for us.

167	Probably $.75 plus postage and 150 cards.
167	Gifts probably go to 20 customers for a cost of $500 - $600.

169	Very Interesting
170	As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary: Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.
170	I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.
170	She consistently does not take messages properly.
170	Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.
170	When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.
170	She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.
170	The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.
170	She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.
170	If she does it is after they have been in there for days.
170	We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.
170	In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.
170	She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.
171	that's great!
172	Thanks alot.

0	Sorry , I have not given you feedback earlier but I've been on vacation.
0	Randy continues to do an excellent job.
0	He anticipates questions and usually has the answers.
0	He is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on his knowledge base.
0	He has helped the traders trade the permian and waha points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas.
0	The only area for improvement that I might suggest would be to challenge others or state his opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say anything or go along with the status quo.
0	He tends to want to be nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion.
1	Becky- If Burlington and Amoco have the right to turn back east end transport-ENA would like to be included in that group regarding turning back our Havasou transport.
2	Us girls have talked about visiting you but just couldn't agree on a date.
2	Joe and I just got back from a vacation in Banff, Canada with Jackie and Dannie.
2	We had a wonderful time.
2	We did some major hiking there.
2	It was so relaxing.
2	We had no t.v.
2	or phone for a week.
2	We're going to Montana over Labor Day week-end for Joe's niece's wedding.
2	Can't believe Joe and I are taking 2 vacatins this year.
2	Regarding logistically getting to your ranch, is it possible to fly into Colorado Springs or do we need to fly into Denver?
2	We would love to come visit you if we can agree on a date because I love to hike.
3	It's not looking good to come visit you this summer.
3	Deb is moving into her new house sometime during th end of July and then she promised to take her nieces and nephews on vacation sometime this summer.
3	I think we are going to try for next spring or summer to come visit you if the offer is still open..
3	Sorry- I'm sure you are disappointed.
3	However, if something changes, we will let you know.
4	I don't think I do but thanks anyway.
5	I just received the shirts this morning.
5	They are perfect.
5	It's a pleasure doing business with you.
6	When are we going to lunch in your new car?
7	Since I do not track actual volume flows , you probably can contact Morgan at ext 36406.
7	She handles border flows.
8	Why are you sending this to me?
9	What am I suppose to do?
9	I don't trade barrels of crude and is the dispute regarding the price of crude on certain days or what?
9	I think this is an old del that Fred Lagrasta did.
10	Below is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint against El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point.
10	The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts to Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs of $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and the gathering fuel was increased.
10	Accordingly, producers are seeking a minimum of $17 million in compensation in some form or another.
10	The biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the Socal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day.
10	Socal Gas stated that this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to as Gatekeeper)..
10	The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could be implemented as early as October 1, 2001.
10	When the Gatekeeper is implemented , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock border and must match up with the intra-state transport.
10	SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the capapcity- 400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock; and 180 to PGE Topock.
10	They also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but needed a minimum of 300 to meet core needs.
10	However, they wanted some type of compensation if their volume was reduced.
10	They also agreed to live with the status quo until the Gatekeeper was implemented.
10	This would result in firm rights being established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.
10	Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.
10	After much discussion, El Paso came back with the following counter proposal: Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.
10	Does not relate to receipt point rights.
10	1) Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000); 2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000) 3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or Ehrenberg.
10	It is recommended that they give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional 70000 mmbtu/day from Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx.
10	115000 being shifted to Ehrenberg.
10	4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows: 5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows: Expansion Shippers 78000 El Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams) Total 851000 540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.
10	The producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and felt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off the top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.
10	Separate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El Paso's counter -proposal.
10	Producer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent thruput increased.
10	Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other forms of compensation.
10	For the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge Topock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as converting that path to a 100 volumetric rate.
10	In other words, if the producers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.
10	If they did not, they would not pay anything.
10	Block 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.
10	For volumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 100 percent volumetric rate.
10	Bottom-line is how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this case.
10	Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will study its entirety.
10	No follow-up meeting was scheduled.
10	Another topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived gaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more gas than they need in anticipation of cuts.
10	It is thought that if this could be controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows.
10	El Paso recommended the following : Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan based on previous day's total nom from all basins.
10	No limits on Cycle 2-4.
10	This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings andfluctuatingpower-plant loads.
10	However, eoc's were willing to establish a technical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets resolved.
10	Regarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the keystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the bondad.
10	This process is in its early stages of conflict.
10	Most people (Duke, Southern, Williams, Coral) are not on board with this.
10	I will keep you advised of development.
10	Please advise if you have any questions.
11	highland Also, Ican't find any of my bookmarks on internet explorer.
11	Where do I find them?
12	Meeting was cancelled and never took place.

16	The pictures came through the second time.
16	Hey-did you get my gift basket.
17	If it is not too late I would like to put on hold my request to add Barrett Resources to the EOL Product for El Paso Blanco Average.
17	I made the request yesterday so hopefully I am not toolate.
17	Upon discussing the product with Barrett, I do not think this would be a good idea to add them at the present time.
17	I willkeep you advised.
17	Thank you for your patience.
18	they are precious-he is a cutie for being only a couple of weeks old-thanks for sending me these
19	My husband and his friends want me to inquire more about your fishing lodge and prices.

19	Hope you have a great day and it was great seeing you.
20	yes we are going
21	this afternoon-any time
22	How come it doesn't work on my eol machine?
23	Southwest Gas currently views Enron Online but is afraid to transact physical volumes on it because they are afraid the payment terms on Enron Online are different than non-EOL trades.
23	They stated that they reveiwed the EOL contract and that it does not address payment.
23	I told them that the payment terms do not differ but they are asking for something in writing.
23	Can you send them something.
24	The sound card does not work on my eol machine-it works on the keyboard supporting eol which is opposite of what I want.
24	I want the screen to ding every time someone trades on eol.
24	I don't want to listen to my self type in deals on the keyboard.
24	My Enron computer system works fine right now.
24	If you could handle getting the eol problem fixed I would appreciate it.
25	Please add me to the critical notices for Transwestern and El Paso Pipeline(s) as soon as possible.
25	If you have any questions , please call me at 35539.
26	no-I wanted my machine to make a sound every time someone traded on EOL but instead it's hooked up to my keyboard so that when I type the keyboard makes sounds instead.
27	email address is jane.m.tholt@enron.com pager is 8005060869 I trade the west desk
28	We are trying to think of something nice to send to Patti to show her our appreciation for her hard work.
28	I was thinking of a gift basket from SPECS with some nice wine.
28	Can you tell me what kind of wine she likes or suggest another alternative for a gift that she may enjoy.
28	Thanks.
29	I do not track volumes but I will forward this to our scheduling group-Patti Sullivan
30	Please give me any concerns you have with this by the end if the day-otherwise I am recommending adopting this proposal
31	Please give us the names of the wines she likes when you have time.
32	Looks good to me.
32	Thanks.
33	this is a joke
34	I am getting your critical notices but when I click on it, I can't get access to what it says.
34	Is this a problem on your side or on my side.
35	You're not going to believe this.
35	I talked to Amoco and they confirmed that I did the deal with them but they said thawe should just pay Agave Energy because tit's a complicated internal deal.
35	So we are both right..
35	I only wished Amoco would have told me ahead of time.
35	Bottom line- pay Agave Energy and not Amoco
36	Norm was somewhat prophetic when he kept talking about the "big hole in his pipe" that was going to occur if we went to rankings-little did he know-can't blame this one on rankings
37	This is O.K as long as we get a daily estimate of usage around 8:30 C.T.
37	and access to actuals within two business days.
38	Do we need to carify the max daily quantity on which the demand charge is assessed reflects usage and not nominations.
38	Just don't want to be in a position where we must do make-up and have to nom more than 20000.
39	I will let Joe know that you received his care package.
39	He will be very happy.
39	When I get my pictures developed, I'll send you any good ones that may have turned out.
39	It's O.K.
39	to give Julie my e-mail address.
39	I would love to communicate with her.
39	Take care.
40	This was an EOL deal and EOL only trades in increments of 5000 so Zarin is not correct per our records.
41	are you talking actual flows or what wAS NOMINATED
42	Need to narrow down timing of their notification-sounds like they can call us one day prior to noms due-that's too late to try to manage financially.
43	that works

45	I think your decorator was a little disappointed in all of the progress we made.-he probably thought you would want to hire help.
45	Can't believe he didn't say anything about all of the beautiful glas syou have.
45	Hey-we may want to thin about putting one of your big mirrors in your purple/black bedroom next to the TV hutch-nearthat corner instead of in the purple/green room.

47	Every room is a sweat.
47	Just call and ask for it.
48	I had a thought.
48	I wonder how far away Nancy Gardiner is from Vail because maybe we could go se her on Saturday or maybe we just want to take it easy in Vai and just relax.

67	I have talked to Julia's secretary and plane and hotel reservations have been reserved for Julie.

71	The phone number at the Barbizon Hotel is 212-838-5700.
71	Enron has a corporate rate there.
71	Suppose to be $222.00 Deb- if you want to try to get your own room-be sure to ask for the Enron Corp rate.
71	RE: Europe.
71	There are several hotels in London which are listed as giving Enron corporate rates -prices range from $69 to 215.
71	The Ritz is $180.
71	I show no discounts for hotels in Paris.
72	What do you think about this strategy?
72	Maybe we should have Deb call Marion and review the list of hotels where Enron has a corporate rate and ask her opinion regarding which ones she would recommend.
72	Maybe -at that point she would volunteer her flat?
73	Thanks for the information.
73	Joe got a chuckle last night when I told him that you tried his ketchup trick.
74	Looked on Continental for prices on our flights.
74	Continental direct flight to Paris in April is about $880.

83	Congratulations, I can tell you are very excited about this.
83	Speaking of digging, on Thursday, they had a crew in our neighborhood digging to lay fiber-optic cable, they hit a sewer line and then the gas line and blew up 2 houses.
83	I walked over there yesterday, one house is completely gone, the house next door is only half there and the houses across the street are all boarded up because they blew the windows out of it.

94	I only buy pool gas-Can you make it available at the appropriate pool.
95	Friday was so perfect.
95	It snowed huge snow flakes.
95	Accumulation was just about 1/4 inch.
95	The temperature was about 35 degrees and it wasn't windy-so it was just a great day to walk the streets and take in all the snow.
95	It just felt like Christmas.
95	We took a carriage ride around Central Park and they dropped us off at Tavern on the Green for lunch.
95	Met one of my contacts at Prebon for lunch and he paid for it.
95	.
95	Good thing because we were drinking mimosas at $10.00 a pop.
95	We saw two great plays-Aida and the Lion King.
95	Excellent.
95	Actually, Aida may be the best broadway play I have ever seen.
95	The music was awesome.
95	Lion King had great special effects with all of the costumes.
95	The people were dressed like animals and it was really cool.
95	Prebon got us tickets for that too-first row-center section-mezz.
95	level.
95	In other words-perfect seats.
95	On Saturday, we mostly shopped during the day.
95	Deb bought herself a new David Yurman diamond ring and red leathe coat.
95	You can't believe the people that were shopping.
95	We went to FAO Schwartz early-9:00 a.m.-and at 3:00 the line was clear around the building to get in. The large department stores were like that too-hoards of people.
95	You could hardly walk down 5th avenue, it was so crowded.
95	I have never seen so many mink coats in my life.
95	Everyone had one on.
95	The hotel we stayed at was excellent.
95	It didn't have the view you did.
95	Nothing will ever match that.
95	But all three of us stayed in one room and the room was huge and nicely decorated.
95	All three of us were able to get ready in a span of one hour.
95	We ate at some good restaurants too.
95	The first night was this small Italian restaurant.
95	Very authentic.
95	They took good care of us.
95	The second night was Thai-food was excellent.
95	The third day was French.
95	YUM YUM.
95	We got out of town just in time.
95	We really lucked out.
95	I would go back agai n if the right opportunity came up.

120	Please get with her ondetails.
121	triggers are based upon scheduled volume-they are not going to agree-I know
122	I'm not sure what contract this falls under.
122	Our contract says that if buyer does not schedule then buyer will pay replacement price differential plus $.15.
122	Rpalcement price differnetial would be gas daily which was around 16.80 on that day.
123	this was a regular 30 day deal.
124	yes -if that's what the contract says
125	This is not going to get resolved.
125	They disagree with our view and are not going to pay on scheduled volumes.
125	However, we are not going back off our view and will continue to bill based on scheduled volumes.
126	Gas daily plus $.15-make sure legal approves
127	I got the pictures.
127	He is precious.
127	I can see why you are so happy and want to stay home with him.

167	It must have been a new plane because the first class section was huge.
167	I sat in a chair that was like a lazy boy chair-it had a fott recline and everything.
167	Also had my own pop up TV and could watch my choice of 4 movies.
167	It was truly awesome.
167	Can't believe what a small world it is.
167	Went to lobby to get somebreakfast and Patrick Brown was there-ended up having breakfast with him and some ohter Sempra folks.Then I had to go to Vegas a couple of weeks ago.

167	He works for Cinergy but is doing east coast stuff-thank God.
167	Our retail group just hired Joe Deschamps and Chris Shireman-remember them?
167	I bet Joe won't be there by the end of the year-I think he just wanted someone to pay for his way back to Houston.
167	Just found out that Bob Shiring went to work for Pan Canadian doing east coast stuff.
167	Joe's brother was in town this week-end from Montana.
167	He picked him up in San Antonio so we had them all week-end .

167	Deb and I had lunch with Julia.
167	She's gone from Enron now.
167	She did not give us any more details about her marriage other than she got married out of town and in am place that made it difficult to track marriage l icense.
167	Her family still does not know she is married.
167	She is being really strange about this whole thing.
167	She qwon't acknowledge to anyone that she is married.
167	I've given up on her.
167	She is almost as strange as you at times.
167	Luckily I have not given up on you .

195	I di d not do any deals with Roger for that time frame.
195	You need to find out who he talked to.
196	Ok to book for me and my husband, Joseph.

197	I got some San Diego stuff for you.
197	I am going to call you tomorrow to ride in with me on Wednesday.
197	I will give the info to you then.
198	Why can't you find them in sitara?
199	What is the term of the deal and we need to address different weekend volumes
200	I don't need an entire table but will share.
200	Could use 3 or 4 seats.
201	Believe it or not, I have booked my trip to London and Paris.
201	I am coming out there around October 4 with my freind Deb and her freind Christie.
201	We are staying at Mark Frevert's flat.
201	Hopefully, we can get together for lunch or dinner during that time.
201	I'll get back to you in a couple of months wonce I know more about our plans.
202	you may want to call Keith Holst to get an update for the winter prices-they have really fallen in the last couple of days
203	Sounds good to me as long as I have my own bathroon at the hotel in Paris.
203	Why does the description for the double include a shower.?
203	Does that mean that single rooms only have a bath tub?
204	Can we imbalance trade this gas.
204	What happens when the cogen burns the gas without telling us like they have been doing.
204	Which desk keeps the 15000 demand charge?
205	Does the gas desk keep the demand charge?
205	Also, we need to discuss-if you forget tocall.
205	If you forget to call, the price between the gas and power desk needs to be negotiated.
205	Probably not a big deal in the summer but is a huge del in the winter with daily balancing.
205	Also, the gas desk will not be responsible for any imbalance penalties if you forget tocall.
205	If you forget tocall in the winter under daily balancing, your desk will be charged my cost.
205	Otherwise, I think it's a go.
206	We had a great time.
206	Let me know when you are not too busy to have lunch with the little people.
206	You are the one that always cancels-remember?
207	I do not show a deal for this .
207	Does our scheduilng group show volume for it?
208	the deal number is 814014-why can't you see this?
209	Actually-upon second look the deal number is 814014-why can't you see this?
210	should be non bondad
211	actually -for volumes flowing out of bondad-which is deal number 763736 price is bondad gda;for blanco-deal number 759933-price is nonbondad gda
212	I talked with Markat SW Gas-just honro his numbers
213	I have not had the patience to get it working-I will callyou some evening and we can walk thru it.
213	How was your trip to Des Moines?
213	Did dthat stuff form Joe help your car.
214	She is having physical therapy 3 times a week and she says it's getting better.
214	I haven't seen her for acouple of weeks so I don't know for sure.
214	Hey-I will be calling you next week-the desk wants me to become more involved in regulatory updates so I will be calling you for your assistance.
215	yes I am going.
215	I will also need toknow if there are signigicant items going to be considered at the weekly FERC meeting and what items are being considered on consent agenda.
215	We want to know ahead of item which itmes are being ruled on .
216	At he El Paso technical conference , one of the FERC staff guys said that full requirements is dead.
216	There is an awfull lot of pressure being put on El Paso at the meeting to path their system.
216	The full requirements customers have to submit to El Paso 4 different load profiles-Becky has the details.
216	It sounds , though, that full requirements may be addressed in the proceeding.
216	However, that does not mean that any transport will open up to Arizona.
216	The conference call was a nonevent.
216	I guess we are trying to find out how Socal calculates its WACOG.
216	So we want to put pressure on them to get details.
216	We want to put pressure on all of the state commisiions to allow LDC to hedge and not be punished for it.
217	Youare doing a good job keeping us up to date.
217	Thank you.
218	Mike Grigsby agrees that we should join complaint
219	don't forget-they could ask for any CD turnback as well to minimize expansion requirements We will turn back BLK 2 if given chance
220	Becky- I don't thin we should rely on displacement to serve the needs of the full requirements because i t may cause me to flow gas that may be uneconomical
221	I made a minor correction
222	If there is anything you may need from the cash desk that could be of assistnace, please let me know and I will ty to help.
222	Looks like accounting is going to have to give you most of the info for compliance.
223	Attached are the non-binding receipt point allocations for the existing firm agreements for Enron North America.
223	Please call me at713-853-5539 if you have any questions.
224	I show 2.525 but since this is a buy and would be in our favor-go ahead and honor thier price
225	Customer is correct.
225	I changed the deal in sitara.
226	Becky-we can just intervene as an interested party-no ax to grind
227	I have received a new book name and ID so I am no longer using that book name or id
228	ok to book.
228	Thank you.
229	We'll do anything to try to make a buck.
230	Can you provide the West Desk with an update on the Socal Storage projects-Socal Montebello Salvage Project ;Alsio Canyon and Lo goleta Cushion Gas Projects Would like to have something by this afternoon if possible.
231	Thank you for the update.
231	If there statuses change, please advise.
232	Mike really enjoyed the meeting yesterday.
232	Thank you both for attending.
232	We are scheduled to have that same meeting every two weeks.
232	I hope that one or both of you can attend via conference call or in person..
232	I will try to remember to call you on the day of the meeting to see if you want to attend or to advise you of any change in plans.
232	Thanks again .
233	no- the more the merrier.
233	Just need to get her phonenumber so we can hook her up..
233	By the way I talked on the QT to the Socal Gas trader and told him that I could not fathom that they would even consider 143 receipts points.
233	He said Rob Davis is clueless and currently is on a power trip.
233	They are going to meet with him next week to make sure that he understands that he works for them and not the other way around.
234	that's up to you.
234	Stephanie and I are going.
234	Have not seen agenda.
235	I am deferring t this to you but I don't see any reason we would have any problem with this either.
236	thank you for handling this
237	II think you should just call her and tell her that you are an interested party in the proceeding and would like to attend.
237	Shw willnot have aproblem/
238	At our last meeting, you aid that you had informationregardin gSouthwest Gas' load profile.
238	Could you send it to me.
239	Are you referring to Los Angeles Water and Power
240	no one in the Houston gas side makes any sales-However you need to check with the Portland office-try calling Chris Foster
241	call 713-515-0389
242	As of 10:00 a.m. Joe is in Wichita
243	did you talk to him
244	I have to take care of my baby.
245	Looks good.
245	Aslo we ar still on for our meeting on Thursday at 2:30.
245	Is Leslie coming?
246	That's right.
246	Feed him milk -not beer
247	Where did you sleep l ast night.
247	By theway, Brad does not want the couch.
248	Phone Number is 713-345-4154.
248	What number should I try to call you at if we have trouble connencting?
249	can you give me an idea of the locations for the gas- I was only trading blanco at the time.
249	The 4.70 price looks like it's at a different location
250	We aslo want to add the California delivery points as receipts points with a potential interruptible back-haul rate to the EOC delivery points.
251	I was thinking that may be we should ask El Paso to furnish aver.
251	daily volumes that were scheduled as receipts into El Paso' system from the proposed 20 pools from Jan 1- Aug 31 of this year to get an indication of whether there is any gas behind these pools.
251	What do you think?
252	let's ask for it by month.
252	In talking to Socal Gas, they suggested that we ask the question and explain why we are asking so that the FERC staff understnads why.
252	Should we ask the question and then say that this information is needed to determine if actual supplies exist behind the proposed pools since the allocations are being made based on design capapcity and not actual gas.
253	They should be able to track by each of the meter numbers of the individual points that make up the pools .

14	Hello Bill, It was great to get your note today.
14	I also think of you often.
14	Thanks for the complements concerning Enron, as always I am very proud of Enron where we've been and where it seems we are going.
14	Work is going well, Business with Prebon is still null.
14	Has nothing to do with Cathy I think she is a great person and a good broker, it just doesn't seem like they (Prebon) has any good information and markets anymore.
14	It is sad actually, ever since you left the group things have never been the same.
14	YOU made a big difference there.
14	Yes I would love to try and meet with you.
14	I need more information though.
14	Things are kinda hectic here and at home so timing is everything for me these days.
14	Lunch is out of the question.
14	So we are looking at drinks or dinner.
14	the week of the 20th is better.
14	The week of the 25th is not going to be easy cuz it is settlement week.
14	Pam is doing fine.
14	Still looking for a job.
14	Hopefully something will happen soon.
14	She had mentioned that you wrote a note, I guess I got the impression she had replied.
14	She is a little stressed in trying to get things settled in her life so just give her some time.
15	How are you today ?
15	Must be busy, I havn't heard form you much.
15	I am bored.
16	Sorry for the delay in getting back to you .

19	Thank you for your thoughts.
20	I have received your E-Mail .
20	Steve, I have likewise done alot of reflecting about our dinner and the events that followed.
20	As of now I have no plans to do business with Natsourse.
20	You need to also be aware that this will include Gulf Coast Basis and Gas Dailys.
20	Thank You
21	Steve, My opinion of your organization and the way they chose to handle themselves in a stressful situation, is such that I prefer not to have any business dealings with anyone in the entire organization.
21	I am sure that Matt and Darryl are good people and good brokers.
21	The bottom line is ( I do not believe you are getting) that I do not want to, and do not plan to do business with Natsourse today or in the future.
22	Steve - will you call me, when you get a moment>
23	i dont get it
24	sounds great - but i am too conservative.
24	That is alot of $$ for three days.

26	So-------are you still planning the retreat weekend?
26	I am soooo jealous.

77	Please sign me up for a space in the new garage.
78	No problem really- Glad I could help
79	Too Funny!
80	Learn the ins and outs of filing after mid-April deadline Tribune Media For the many millions of individuals who have yet to file their 2000 income tax returns, there is no reason to panic.
80	If you need more time to file your return, you can easily get a filing extension.
80	And if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now, you can buy more time to pay up.
80	While you may be subject to interest and penalties for payments made after April 16, you can put off the day of reckoning for months without fear that IRS collection agents will come after you.
80	There is even a loophole in the law that will enable many individuals to get an extra month to pay up without being assessed interest or penalties.
80	Nevertheless, April 16 is a critical deadline for anyone who has yet to file his tax returns.
80	You'll need to file either your tax return or an extension request by the deadline.
80	And to avoid interest and penalties, you'll generally need to pay any taxes owed by April 16.
80	April 16 is also the deadline for making IRA contributions for 2000 returns and for making the first installment of quarterly estimated taxes for 2001.
80	Filing extension: If you'd like more time to file your return, getting a filing extension is simple.
80	In fact, the IRS has expanded the options this year for obtaining a filing extension.
80	You can now do it by phone, computer or mail.
80	The traditional way to get an extension is to fill out IRS Form 4868, "Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return" and mail it to the IRS by the April 16 deadline.
80	If you're using tax-preparation software or a tax professional, you can file your extension request by computer.
80	Or you can phone in your extension request by calling 888-796-1074.
80	If you owe the IRS money, another option for requesting an extension is to make the payment by credit card (American Express, Discover or MasterCard) on the Internet or by phone through one of the two companies the IRS has authorized for processing credit card payments.
80	Details on the option are included in the Form 4868 instructions.
80	By making the extension request, the IRS will automatically give you four more months, until Aug. 15, to file your return.
80	You can get an extension for any reason.
80	No explanation is asked for when requesting an extension.
80	But be aware that your extension request only gives you extra time to file your return, not to pay your taxes.
80	To avoid interest and possible penalty charges, you must estimate how much you owe and make the payment with your extension request by the April 16 deadline.
80	Unable to pay: If you can't afford to pay your tax bill, you should at least file an extension request by the April 16 deadline.
80	Though you'll be subject to interest and possible penalty charges for late payment of your taxes, you'll avoid being hit with a late-filing penalty, which runs a steep five percent a month (up to a maximum 25 percent.) Installment plan: If you still don't have the cash to pay your taxes by the time your extension runs out on Aug. 15, you can negotiate with the IRS to pay your balance due in monthly installments.
80	You make the request for an installment agreement when you file your completed tax return using Form 9465, "Installment Agreement Request."
80	"Offer in compromise": If you can't afford to pay all you owe in taxes, even in installments over a period of years, you may be able to work out a settlement with the IRS.
80	The IRS recently expanded its "Offer in Compromise" program, in which taxpayers in tough financial situations can offer to settle for less than they owe.
80	Offers are submitted using IRS Form 656, "Offer in Compromise."
80	A loophole offers an extra month to pay up: If all you need is an extra month or so to come up with the cash to pay your tax bill, there is a way you may be able to get a short reprieve without being subject to interest or penalties.
80	All you need do is take the IRS up on its offer to calculate your tax bill for you.
80	If you're eligible for the offer, fill out your tax return, stopping short of computing certain totals, and send it in by April 16.
80	The IRS will compute your tax and send you a bill for any tax owed.
80	If you pay within 30 days of the notice, you won't be assessed any penalties or interest.
80	To take advantage of the loophole, your taxable income must be less than $100,000 and you can't itemize deductions.
80	The full list of eligibility requirements and step-by-step instructions are contained in IRS Publication 967, "The IRS Will Figure Your Tax."
80	Retirement account contributions: If you hope to contribute to an Individual Retirement Account, the final deadline for 2000 tax-year contributions is April 16, even if you obtain a filing extension.
80	The deadline is more flexible for self-employed retirement plans.
80	Contributions to Keogh or Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans can be made up until the due date of your return, which can be later than April 16 with a filing extension.
80	Estimated tax deadline: For self-employed workers and other individuals who need to make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS, April 16 also is the deadline for making the first installment for 2001.
81	Hello Kenny, Just a note to say Hello and that I love you .
81	I enjoyed yesterday afternoon.
81	And I also wanted to thank you for getting up early this morning and fixing my coffee and my slim fast.

81	Love and Kisses Sandra
82	Jeff, I needed to apologize for my inability to handle myself in more of a professional manner.
82	I thought I had moved on from being an emotional basket case , but as we found out, I haven't..
82	Again , please accept my apology.
82	I just need to move forward and stop reflecting on the past.
82	It is so difficult when you have given your entire career for an organization that still doesn't see value in you.
82	But, that is my problem not yours.
82	In regards to your party , your right, I laughed at the invitation - (It is so Shankman) - Sorry I will not be able to attend.

112	Please accept my sincere apology.
112	Sandra
113	As I sit here this Wednesday morning and watch ENE trade $15.80 I can not begin to explain the pit in my stomach.
113	I have been an employee of Enron since June of 1984, I have never written a memo to my CEO to express opinions and or ask direct questions.
113	I can not believe that the individuals that are responsible for this catastrophe are still employed.
113	And I guess I need to understand why?
113	FIRED THEM !
113	It is apparent to me that the information we have given to the market place is not sufficient enough.
113	"THEY" don't trust us anymore.
113	Get a plan of action, attack it, and save this company.
114	I had mentioned to you last night that I would forward you the memo I sent my CEO of Enron yesterday.
114	Today seems better here, not so much anger around the trade floor.
114	This is our BID Week so we have alot of business to take care of.
114	And as of 9:11 this morning our stock is actually up slightly for the 1st time in weeks.
114	Hopefully, we can close ont he Highs.
115	Scott, Just a quick note.
115	I believe you did a great job this afternoon in communicating with your group about Enron's "cluster."
115	Today I have found this overwhelming since of Pride for this company and I don't want it to fail.
115	So if there is ANYTHING I can do to help please let me know.
115	I am in for the challenge and the long haul.
115	Sincerely, Sandra
116	Louise, Sempra Energy has called and asked to "cover' outstanding positions with Enron. They have done some deals with me this morning via EOL, as well as a "sleeve" with EPNG in order to minimize their exposure with us. Indications were that they have longer dated power and other gas positions that they want to minimize as well, I advised them to call the respected traders first, as apposed to calling voice brokers, to see what they can facilitate.
117	I have no idea what this e-mail is suppose to mean to me?
118	I thought I would share with you some of the E-Mails I get from my firends in the business that I am in - we ladies tend to share theses with each other - because we work in a mans world.
119	Brad, I really don't know where to begin other than just to say it.
119	Enron is having some extremely difficult times now.
119	I have been trying to focus on helping Enron stay together.
119	This is not a good time for you or anyone else to try and seek employment here.
119	I am sorry if I am letting you down.
119	I was only wanting to help.
119	I will always keep you in mind, and hopefully when things turn around here I will be able to address you coming here.

134	Thanks Sandra
135	David, Per a conversation with John Lavorado he mentioned that an amended agreement was coming for my signature.
135	I was curious as to when I should be expecting the amended agreement, could you confirm please.
136	Yes, I signed and returned the original one last week.
136	Your assistant verified that Enron had received it.
136	It is the revised one I am curious as to the status.

71	For the year I was in ISG, I never had to adjust the reg.risk book.
71	I did not hand over the files to anyone else because the group was breaking up and figured it was better that I keep them.

71	In rotating down to East Orig.
71	I lost a box of stuff, but I didn't think it had those files in it, but it looks like that was the case.

115	Ben
116	It was good to see a fellow Yankee down in these here parts.
116	I got some really good feedback from all the people I talked with.
116	I think that UT would be a good fit for what I'm trying to do afterwards - with there energy-finance concentration and investment fund.
116	Plus it would be fun living in Austin for a couple of years.
116	When your in Houston next time wh can grab some drinks and go to dinner.
116	Talk to you soon.
116	Ben
117	Thanks for the informative infomation session this past Friday.
117	Also, thank you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application and talking to Dr. Harris for me.
117	After meeting with many of the faculty and staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the School, my desire to attend the School is quite strong.
117	The School is a perfect fit for the career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where I would be able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my experiences with Enron.
117	Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as the GMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have proven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. Enron).
117	I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the many people I talked with at the Texas B-School.
117	Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living in Texas, such as myself.
117	Regards, Ben Rogers

164	Professor Titman: Thank you for talking with the people in the admissions office.
164	I wanted to ask you what you think I could do at this point to help the admission's people understand the reason for my GMAT score.
164	I know that this is a poor reflection of what I can actually achieve and I know that I will do well and be successful in the learning environment at UT.
164	If I need to, I can provide the admissions office the documents stating the disability.
164	If you can let me know what you think I can do, I would appreciate it.
164	Thanks agin!
164	Ben
165	Meg: I would like to make sure that I have fully explained the reason for my GMAT score.
165	If the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on this disability I can do that.
165	Due to this disability, the GMAT score is not a good indicator of how I will do at UT.
165	Through what I have learned in my work experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will be able to successfully do the work that UT requires.
165	If you could let me know what I can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly appreciate it.
165	If you think it would be better to talk to Dr. Harris-I will do that.
165	Thanks again for taking the time to help me with this issue.

172	He wants me to answer a few questions, making sure I will be able to handle the MBA coursework.
172	That was one of my main reasons for meeting with you and the Professors' Ronn and Brown, is to talk to you about the course work and inform you of my strengths and weaknesses, to make sure I could do the work.
172	I know that with my financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance background and the Business School's team-oriented approach to learning, that I will excel in this learning environment.
172	I will convey this message and others to him by tomorrow.
172	I hope things workout and thanks again for your help.
172	Ben
173	Just to give you an update, I reeived an e-mail from Dr. Carl Harris, who is currently in charge of my application in the admission's office.
173	He wants me to answer a few questions to make sure I can handle the coursework.

173	I know that with my financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance background, and the Business' School's team-oriented approach to learning, that I will excel in this type of learning environment.

181	Sorry for the late reply, I was in NYC and Boston on one of my deals.
181	The two companies I talked about was Relient and Entergy.
181	Relient ended up buying 19 LM 6000 turbines and Entergy ended up buying 28 LM 6000 turbines.
181	They both plan to put them into customer deals, just as we are doing - so there is a little competition.
181	The delivery dates are a little further out than ours but they all are probably delivered by 2003.
181	Hope this helps.
181	Talk to you soon.
181	Ben
182	I have been out of the office until now, so I will talk to you later today about the model.
182	Thanks Ben
183	Dr. Harris: Sorry for the delay, I have been traveling with work and I just got back an hour ago.
183	I can try and retake the GMAT exam if this will help my overall application file.
183	I must say, due to my disability, I don't think my score would improve dramatically.
183	I can also send you a summary (or the whole report) on my disability from the professional examiner to further explain my disability.
183	I can also provide addition recommendations from my colleagues I work with to further demonstrate my achievements at work.
183	If you could let me know what information would help best explain my disability, I would appreciate it.
183	Thanks again for your e-mail and sorry for the delay.
183	Ben
184	Dr. Harris: Since I am a eternal optimist, I always feel I can strengthen my skills in most everything I do, but under these circumstances with the GMAT (timed exam) combined with my disability, I feel this is my best representation for this exam.
184	Also, I know that you would not what me to take the exam just to retake it, but due to my strong desire to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business, I would try to provide any additional information you needed to help strengthen my overall application file.
184	Again, thanks for the fast response to my e-mail.
184	Hope to hear from you soon!
184	Sincerely, Ben

191	I am finding out whether I can send your parents the tickets early or if we will meet them at the "will call window" at the RCA Dome.
191	These are box seats so I don't know if we can get them earlier or not.

197	Dr. Harris: I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review my application.
197	Though I am disappointed with the results I am still determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year.
197	I understand how competitive the process has become, but I felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, personality, extracurricular activities, etc. that this would compensate for my disability.
197	After talking with Professors Titman, Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that the School was the right place to get the education I was looking for.
197	I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year.
197	I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the graduate level.
197	I also plan on retaking the GMAT test.
197	Due to my disability, this will be a monumental task; but I am determined to prove to the Committee that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business.
197	I would like to come down to Austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss my application file and to personally meet you.
197	If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.
197	Take care and hope to hear from you soon.
197	Sincerely, Ben Rogers

198	He doesn't want them to get lost in the mail.

198	The best thing to do is meet at a certain gate # or the "will call window".
198	I will call your Dad next week and set things up on a meeting place before the game.
198	Leave me your Dad's home number so I can call him next week.

224	The meeting Don and I had with Kinder/Morgan to discuss his Price Risk Management Product went really well.
224	We met with Park Schaper (CFO), Anthony Lannie (President of Power Group) and Jay Hopper (VP and General Manager) was on the phone from Denver.
224	They were very interested with regards to potentially replacing long term tolling agreements with this product.
224	Enron could provide a five year toll and the product would begin in the sixth year through year 15 or 20.
224	We talked very little about their existing projects; Little Rock and Michigan.
224	They do have all the permits for the Little Rock site and are moving forward with the Michigan site and still do not have any tolling agreements in place for those projects.
224	The ball is currently in their court and were going to get back with Scot with respects to the projects and with Tom on the PRM Product.

271	Working with Insurance group (weather desk) to wear the risk of the project, since the Power desk will not wear that type of risk.
271	Pricing of the put, call and spread option values is still not finalized, because Kevin Presto has said that he does not put much value into these plants in Eastern PJM Don Black is beginning to look at other companies for his price risk management product.
271	He feels he will not be able to get a deal done with Teco at this point in time.
271	Let me know if this is suffient for your analysis.
271	Ben

275	Hope all is well and talk to you soon.
275	Ben
276	I thought that was probably a mistake, because you haven't mentioned it and I don't see why you would sell it while you were away.
276	See ya Ben
277	We are still looking for capital costs for a 730 MW plant in Texas, which comprises of 4 FA's and 2 STG's.
277	We are currently using $450 MM for a total project cost number, which comes out to be $616/Kw.
277	Thanks Ben
278	Here is the e-mail that Bruce just sent me.
278	Make sure that you do not use this for any binding agreements or client discussion purposes.
278	These are the numbers I have used in my model and here are the new Plano numbers.
278	If you have any questions please give me a call and I will walk you through the changes.
278	Thanks Ben
279	Here are the new Plano numbers and the revised Homestead numbers.

280	Ben
281	Hey, sorry its been a little while but I've been traveling and keeping some late hours on these generation projects.
281	With regards to UT, I am going to stay at Enron for another year.
281	I feel that the thing that hurt me from getting in the schools I wanted to get into were my undergraduate grades.
281	So I have decided to take a couple of graduate level finance courses this summer and re-apply next year.
281	Actually, I'll apply to Columbia this Sept to get into their January program, which goes for a year and half.
281	So lets get together for lunch before you head off for B-school this summer.
281	Talk to you soon.
281	Ben
282	Dave: I was talking with my brother-in-law who is Kinder/Morgan's VP of Corp Development and they would be interested in talking with us about contributing their 5,000 MW's of generation into a JV/Partnership to lead into a public offering.
282	We are still under several different CA's with them, due to our past conversation's regarding generation.
282	With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion Project, but at that time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the delivery of the turbines.
282	In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation business, this JV would give them the perfect "exit strategy".
282	Also, it would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other parties.
282	I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth story to Wall Street.
282	If you think this would be a good idea, I can begin to set up a meeting as soon as possible with Kinder/Morgan.
282	Thanks!
282	Ben
283	Here is the combine cycle Florida model.

285	Please give me a call if you have any questions.
285	Thanks!
285	Ben
286	Sounds Good!
286	Ben
287	Ben: I am putting together a presentation for FPL and we are going to show them our potential development sites.

287	I am trying to get a draft to Ozzie tonight.
287	Thanks Ben
288	Here is the latest Entergy presentation Don and I put together.
288	Ben
289	Hey Bruce, Oscar and I are looking to have the first 2 questions answered.

289	Thanks Ben

295	Talk to you soon.
295	Ben
296	Clement: Here is the FPL presentation.
296	If your able to change the graph on page 7, where it just shows the total on the table and not on the graph, that would be great otherwise I will change it in the morning.
296	Thanks Ben
297	Ben: I talked with Thomas Suffield and he wants Miguel Vasquez to run the numbers on the Florida model., since they have been running numbers on the Plano model for a little while now.
297	I walked Miguel through what I had done and how they should look at running the model, based on what Thomas found out and what you have said in the past.
297	I also gave them the numbers that the desk has given based on the simple cycle case (5 year number) and combine-cycle case (5 year number).
297	From this they have modeled and graphed these different scenarios.
297	I also worked on getting a bid and ask from the desk, but you may need to talk to Berney because they are not giving out the ask at this time.
297	Hope this helps and please give me a call if you have any questions.
297	Thanks Ben
298	Please give me a call when you get this.
298	Thanks Ben

308	Regards, Ben

319	Thanks Ben Rogers
320	Great PICS.
320	When do you get back?
320	I want to see if we can get together up in NYC or DC with OB and Mike.
320	I will be in the Hamptons for July 4th weekend.
320	It's starting to get hot down here in Houston.
320	Things are going well.
320	I have moveed into a new group (Enron's M&A Group) - were looking at some interesting deals.
320	We are looking at taking a company public which I may go work for if I can get enough equity in the deal.
320	The other thing that might happen is finally going to my pops company at a much higher position than I am at now, which would be great, but I would be in Ohio, booooooo.
320	That way Megan and I could buy a house and potential go and get an executive MBA from Kellog, but these are all scenarios and if any of these play out I would be amazed.
320	My golf game is ok, but my training is starting to get better.
320	I did see that none of us made the NYC Marathon on the first go around.
320	Did you see that Jon and Kati had their baby-I didn't even know she was pregnant.
320	Shit were getting old!!!!!!!!!!
320	Hope all is going well and I'll see ya.
320	Ben
321	Here is the latest model.
321	It was only used for the project cost analysis and nothing else, so some are are not fully completed.
321	Let me know when you would like to talk about the deal or model.
321	Thanks Ben
322	Hey there, Have I got a potential job opportunity for you.

322	Thanks Ben
323	Yes, she had a boy - Will Rogers Morgan.
323	Are you going to be in the Hamptons for the July 4th holiday?
323	Megan and I will be up there for 4 or 5 days around then.
323	Talk to you soon.
323	Ben
324	Megan will be at the wedding that weekend, but I will not be able to make it.
324	Megan is going to spend most of July up in New York.
324	How is the fundraising business going?
324	I heard that Clinton's fundraiser tonight will bring in $23 million which will be $2 Mil.
324	more than George W., which would be pretty impressive.
324	Ben
325	Hey Jon, Again Congratualations on your baby, that's great.
325	My sister just had her second two weeks ago.
325	Megan and I will be in DC the weekend after the 4th of July for a wedding, will you guys be their that weekend, if so it would be great to see you guys?
325	Hope all is going well and talk to you soon.
325	Ben
326	I lokked for the soft copy of the presentation on the peakers and could not find one in my files.
326	I would try giving Clement a call because he was the one who put it together.
326	Ben
327	Here is the spreadsheet Bruce Golden used to calculate the Homestead project costs.
327	Ben
328	Here is the MW degradation calc.
328	we were talking about.
328	Ben
329	Here is the version that you sent me.
329	I wanted to see if you had a updated version.
329	Thanks Ben
330	John: Here are some of the companies that have announced merchant peaker plants recently.
330	Give me a call if you have any questions.
330	Ben
331	Ben
332	Here is ENA's peaker comp analysis.
332	Ben
333	Here is the spreadsheet with the DCF analysis from CSFB.
333	Ben
334	Don: Regarding my conversation with John Garrison on the GE 7FA costs.
334	It looks like that for every year and a half the costs go up approx.
334	$2.0 MM.
334	The next available order for GE 7FA's is 3rd qtr.
334	2003.

336	Ben
337	Don: I will be leaving early today to catch a flight to New Orleans for a friend's bachelor party in the Big Easy.
337	I will be back early on Sunday, so please leave me a message if you need anything and I will be in on Sunday.
337	Hope to make it back safely.
337	Have a good weekend.
337	Ben
338	Mike: Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week.
338	I left you Rich Kinder's number on Thursday with your assistant, Sheilla - hope you got it.
338	Again, I think a deal between or three companies is something to really look at.
338	I think it creates a great story to the street.
338	Kinder/Morgan brings the growth story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the development team, Enron brings the MW's and trading and Cinergy brings MW's, trading and operating expertise.
338	I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work togther with regards to the trading.
338	I am sending you an anayst report I just finish reading regarding generation spinoffs - I think it will be helpful.
338	Also, Kay Chapman, Dave's assistant informed me that you were coming up next week, and I wanted to know if you wanted me to be there or not or if you wanted me to prepare anything for you for the meeting.
338	Hope you had a good weekend and I look forward to talking to you soon.
338	Regards, Ben
339	A very good time was had by all.
339	I for one lost some shorts and a voice, but it was well worth it.
339	Thanks Miguel and everyone else.
339	Ben
340	Mike: Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan.
340	These guys mainly care about the gas pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to increase throughput.
340	These plants that they want on their lines are currently in construction or development.
340	Their only operational plants are in Colorado.
340	They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as long as somebody wants to put them along their lines.
340	If you guys offered to buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their projects to put on their lines.
340	Hope this helps.
340	Ben
341	Here are some of the points Cinergy will cover on Monday.
341	They are coming down with a team of 4 or 5 people -Mike Cyrus, Bill Greilis, Chuck Winger, Art Vivar and Brian Stall.
341	Ben
342	Hey Jon; Just e-mailing to see how everyone is doing.
342	Megan and I are going over to Austin to a resort to celebrate our 1st anniversary - I can't believe it.
342	I've been trying to work on the golf game, but I'm taking a couple of graduate business courses at night so that keeps me pretty busy on the weekends as well.
342	Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.
342	Go Sox!
342	Ben
343	Dave: I talked with the legal guys at Cinergy and after further discussions with Mike Cyrus, they felt that since these discussions were at a high level and very early in discussions that a "CA" at this time was not needed.
343	There were two sticking points that I was trying to get them to backdown from: 1) a stand-still agreement and 2) a solicitation agreement.
343	They were not willing to back down from these, thus they concluded with suggesting no "CA".
343	Let me know if this is your thoughts as well.
343	Thanks!
343	Ben
344	I am pretty sure I have a copy, but it is really old and out of date, but I will try and find it ASAP and send it on to you.
344	Thanks!
344	Ben
345	Here is the list I was referring to.
345	Ben

385	Dr. Ueng: I wanted to mention this to you yesterday after the test, but didn't have time.
385	I was taking this course because I am applying to another business school and since I have been out of school for six years I wanted to provide the other schools with a recent academic record.
385	I was trying to get an A in the class, but my first test was not my best work.
385	I feel that I did much better on the second test and that Brandon and mines case studies and my class participation were good enough to get me close to the A level.
385	That said if I am also able to get a recommendation from you I would greatly appreciate it.
385	I know that you are extremely busy now, so if I could get in touch with you at your earliest convenience that would be great.
385	Thanks for making the class educational and quite enjoyable.
385	Hope to talk to you soon and hope you can enjoy the rest of the summer.

395	Amy: Here are my answers to your questions: 1.
395	Yes I think its a good idea, because you are able to reach a wide audience with this advertisement.
395	2.
395	I don't think the contest should be limited to just these schools/conferences.
395	You probably should open it up to all schools to get an even wider reach of potential candidates.
395	3.
395	I would think that if you had a certain amount for the cash prize that people would take it seriously to try and win the cash.
395	4.
395	Please let me know if I can support you in any way.

530	Hey Mike: You won't believe whose wedding Megan and I are going to in early Oct. - Marlon and Marissa's.
530	As well as OB, Choby, Mike and like Patty Donahue, Sammy, Amy, etc. It should be pretty interesting to say the least.
530	I am also running in this year's NYC Marathon which falls on the first Sunday in November.
530	So trying to get to the east coast for a third time has been tough to arrange.
530	How was Patty's wedding -it looked like alot of fun.
530	I still want to meet up with you guys somewhere, but I'm just not sure where at this point - I still think DC.
530	Let me know what you think.
530	Ben
531	Luke: How are ya?
531	How is the DC area these days?
531	Houston is still fucking hot and Enron is still doing well and the price is still screaming so things are good.
531	In response to your inquiry regarding Homecoming.
531	Megan and I are actually, if you can believe it, going to Marlon and Marissa's wedding the first weekend in October in NJ.
531	Also, OB, Chobu, Mike, Corpina and Danny, Patty D, Sammy, Amy, etc. are going as well - should be interesting.
531	I haven't seen some of those people for quite awhile.
531	I was trying to set something up, but that came up as well as I'm running in this year's NYC Marathon, which is the first Sunday in Novemebr, so trying to arrange something became even harder.
531	I still want to get together with you guys, but trying to figure out when and where.
531	Suggestions are welcomed.
531	Hope all is going well and talk to you soon.
531	Ben
532	Eric: Am I able to send this 3 page summary out to potential buyers?

554	Ben

555	If you could please add your comments some time this morning, that would be great.
555	Thanks Ben
556	Mitch: Here are the questions for Ameren.
556	I wanted to incorporate your comments before we sent them out today, so if you could comment on some of these questions that would be very helpful.

559	Regarding, the output and heat rates on the turbines, we copied for you the performance tests, which should have summary information on the output and heat rates at the end of each of the performance tests.

559	Ben
560	Jon: Here are the safety record files for the peakers.

561	James: Just wanted to let you know that we sent out 2 books to Tractebel Power, Inc. today.
561	Ben
562	Thanks for the info.
562	We found the org charts.
562	Ben
563	I talked with Theresa Voss about the insurance on the peakers and she said that they have been making payments on the peakers and that this "billing separately plan" on the peakers will last until March of 2001.
563	At that point, an umbrella plan will cover the turbines.
563	Regarding the balance sheet, they have been accounting for it under prepaid insurance and have been amortizing it each month as its been paid.
563	Let me know if you need anything else.
563	Ben
564	I know how e-mail is suppose to work, but its been so crazy here that I haven't even been able to do that.
564	We were here last night till 10:00 and it looks to be the same tonight and potentially for the rest of the year.
564	This project is going to kill me.
564	I glad to see that you are active on the net.
564	I'll keep in touch a little better.
564	Love Ben
565	It wasn't like I was neglecting you.
565	You must understand that e-mail is faster than sending a letter and its slower than calling someone, but there is not always an immediate return.
565	Some people are lazy with returning e-mail.
565	It has been really busy here.
565	We are working long hours and this project is trying to close by the end of the year.
565	It's a $1 Billion project, so it takes alot of work.
565	Talk to you soon.
565	Ben
566	Eric: I got a call from David Martin looking from Jason Staebels phone number.
566	Do you have it or do you know who does?
566	Thanks Ben
567	Here is the our version of the Confidentiality Agreement.
567	Please let me know if you have any questions.

567	Ben
568	Here you go!
568	Again, good to hear from you.
568	Ben
569	Guys: Don Miller and I would like to set some time up with you, today if possible, to talk about state and local tax issues for the 2000 peakers.
569	I will talk with Don about a good time to meet and let you know.
569	But let me know what is a good time for you this afternoon.
569	Thanks for your time.
569	Ben
570	Here is the latest version of the management presentation.
570	We are contining to update and fill in the holes.
570	Please give myself or Don a call if you have any questions.
570	Thanks Ben
571	Squeeze in some golf or bet on the horns - I sure we can find some "other" activities to keep you, I mean us, out of trouble.
571	Ben
572	Dave: Just wanted to remind you about the call I received from Paul Cavicchi with Tractebel.
572	He was calling to ask about an extention to the bidding on the assets.
572	I basically said that there are no extentions except for bids that are strong bids that come in on Monday or Tuesday of next week.
572	He sounded a little disappointed that they got the book so late, but still seemed interested in the assets.
572	Hope this helps.
572	Ben
573	Omar: Here is the final version of the Pastoria Facility.
573	Ben
574	Here is the latest version of the presentation.
574	Ben
575	Cliff: Do you have Dierdre's address in NYC.
575	Megan and I are staying there next weekend and are getting picked up at the airport and need to tell the driver where were going.
575	How is everything going?
575	Slow down the traveling yet?
575	Make sure you include yourself in the Turkey Run on Thanksgiving in Chicago.
575	Talk to you soon.
575	Ben
576	Thanks, C
577	Sorry to hear that.
577	I called Patty again to ask her brother if he knew anybody running the marathon.
577	I also called Megan's sister, Deirdre to see if she knows of anyone not going to run, but signed up.
577	I hope this helps.
577	It would great for you to be in it, running it.
577	Ben
578	Good to hear from you.
578	Yes, it was a wonderful weekend to work all weekend.
578	Were very busy at work and will continue to be so through the rest of the year.
578	It is very upsetting to hear about Kara.
578	Seems like she has a long way to go to recovery, but I'm optimistic that she can get to where she needs to be.
578	I talked to her Sunday morning.
578	She seemed upbeat.
578	I hope the place she is staying at is giving her a glance at how bad it could be so that its kind of a wake up call.
578	Let me know how Megan and I can help.
578	Megan is going to get this really good book on Manic Depression.
578	Hope we can talk about this soon.
578	Love, Your Son

580	This is a test to see if you are checking your e-mail these days.
580	I have a feeling that you have not been, due to your board presentation last week.
580	Mike M. tells me he will be up there today - hope that goes well for you guys.
580	I really think there could be something there.
580	Please give me a call sometime soon.
580	Things are going well here and we have been quite busy.
580	Give me a call sometime.
580	The number is (713) 853-7998.
580	See ya!
580	Ben
581	Yes you have passed the test - Congratualations.
581	We have been working very hard on our sale and wanted to let you know that your guys came back with a very good bid.
581	We will inform you probably this afternoon or tomorrow that you will be making the short list.
581	We will probably have a short list of about 5-7 companies.
581	You guys are in the top three!
581	I think you guys have a very good chance at getting these plants, which I think is an excellent opportunity.
581	Hope all is going well and your other talks are going in the right direction.
581	On a side note, from what I've heard from my parents in Boston, Kara seems to be doing pretty poorly.
581	She is clearly going through some very difficult times.
581	Talk to you soon.
581	Love, Ben
582	Well, I am.
582	It's like this everynight.
582	I thought that you guys going back to Bermuda would be fun.
582	I hope Kara finds a way to battle the problem she has.
582	I tough for me to imagine what kind of place she's in right now.
582	Talk to you soon.
582	Ben
583	Dale: I will be sending you the CA's some time this morning.
583	I needed to wait till we had our conference with the investment bankers, CSFB, to know which companies were going to the second round.
583	I did not want to send you the CA's of companies that were not going on to the second round.
583	Please give me a call if you have any questions.
583	Ben
584	There will be a meeting to discuss the plant visits at 1:00 pm Today!
584	The room is EB 3125B.
584	Please let Don Miller know if you won't be able to make it.
584	Thanks Ben 3-7998
585	Pam: Per your discussions with Don Miller.
585	Here are the presentations we used in this afternon's recording.
585	One is the actual presentation, which will go online.
585	The other are the sales points that Mike Miller used to go through, which does not go online.
585	Hope this helps.
585	Thanks Ben
586	I will do that first thing on Thursday.
586	I will call you with the results.
586	Ben
587	Thanks!
588	Thanks for your quick reply.
588	With regards to the classes, I looked into U of H for summer classes and they did not provide graduate level summer classes.
588	The only school that provided graduate level summer classes was the University of St. Thomas.
588	It would have been nice to take these classes at U of H, because our Chairman and CEO and my recommender to The Texas Business School, Ken Lay, received his PhD from there.
588	Thanks again for your response and advice and hope all is going well.
588	Regards, Ben
589	Hey there: The industry is getting beat up a little bit, hope that is not effecting any of your plans with anything.
589	I talked to Mike
590	Dad: The industry is getting beat up a little bit, but I hope this isn't slowing you guys down at all.
590	I talked with Mike M the yesterday, he said that his meetings with you guys seem to go well.
590	I think that doing that deal would be quite beneficial to both companies over all strategies, regarding power, gas and cash flow.
590	Megan and I will be in NYC this weekend for a wedding.
590	I would like to talk to you pretty soon anout a couple of things.
590	I have decided to stay at Enron at least till this project is over, which will be early next year.
590	The more experience I have with another company, like Enron the better.
590	I am also going to reapply to just The Texas Business School.

599	Booze, blackjack and bitches!!!
599	What a way to go!!!
600	Just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site visits to the plants.
600	As you already know, site visits begin this Thursday and runs through the 27th of October, so its a pretty tight schedule.
600	In terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and Wheatland will be Ross Newlin.
600	These guys will cover the site visits the next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed.
600	While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager.
600	Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per day.
600	I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling please give me a call.
600	Again, thank you for your help with these issues.
600	Regards, Ben
601	I am putting together that right now.

620	Ben
621	Amy: Forgot to mention timing.

622	I wanted to reply, even though I have called recently.
622	Work has slowed down a little bit, but will probably pick up in a week or two.
622	I have traded calls with Kara the past two days, so I haven't talked to her in some time.

622	We will have to know whether Megan and I need to work on our golf games or not.
622	We have been thinking maybe you guys are thinking about going to Ireland or England to play some of the old courses of this world.

623	Charlie: It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday afternoon at the Columbia Business School information session.
623	As you probably noticed through my enthusiasm, I really enjoy working in the energy-finance industry, especially with Enron.
623	Working in this sector, at this time, has created many new opportunities.
623	I am interested in talking with you to see if we can do some type of transaction with you guys.
623	It sounds like you have a lot going in areas that we might be interested in. If you could send me a business proposal or summary of what your doing, that would be helpful.
623	With regards to Columbia Business School, I applied last year and did not get in due to my GMAT score.
623	I decided to take a graduate level finance class this summer, which I received an A. I am currently taking another graduate finance class this semester.
623	I am also retaking the GMAT, with the hopes of increasing my quantitative score.
623	Last year, I was asked back for an interview, which I felt was a good sign.
623	I heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that I needed to improve on was my GMAT score.
623	Recently, I wrote a brief letter to the Dean of Admissions, Linda Meehan, informing her of my recent actions as well as my continued interest with Columbia.
623	I hope that these actions will help me get into Columbia this year.
623	My desire to go to Columbia, stems from their network, location, reputation and curriculum.
623	Since growing up in Pelham, it would be nice to get back to New York for a little while.
623	As you can see, my desire to go to Columbia is very strong.
623	I hope this brief e-mail has provided some insight into what I'm doing to get into Columbia.
623	I hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the Woodlands or downtown.
623	Again, thank you for your interest and I look forward to talking with you about Columbia and future energy transactions.
623	Regards, Ben Rogers
624	Sounds Good!
625	Thanks for the quick reply.
625	I live within inside the loop on Buffalo Speedway near 59.

625	Let me check to see what day is best and I will send you an e-mail later today to confirm.
625	Hope that works and I'll talk to you soon.

698	John: With regards to the Demin water system, there are no capitalized charges in these cost figures - everything is expensed.
698	With respects to the Electricity, there is a Demand Charge included in this numer, which makes up approximately 50% of the cost.
698	The rest is attributable to energy costs.
698	These costs are levelized for the full 12 months of the year.
698	Please let me know if you have any other comments.

765	Regards, Ben Rogers
766	Michael: Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.
766	I didn't have time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.
766	As you already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guys lose these assets to legal issues.
766	I know we both can come to some middle ground before people lose their patience.
766	My only advice, for what its worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side.
766	Hope this helps.
766	Ben
767	Michael: Duke is presenting their final bid this Sunday, so I think its even more important to get the PSA signed by tomorrow, so that there is no chance to try and retrade the deal.
767	I don't know how things ended up yesterday, but I think things need to come together very fast.
767	Ben
768	Jim: Pat Cathers was going to call you to have you send me e-mail or fax the spare parts list if you haven't done so all ready.

774	Regards, Ben
775	Michael: If you can let me know when you have talked with Dave, that would be great.
775	I am trying to talk with Don Miller and wanted to make sure that you had already talked with Dave.
775	Enron's PRC is going on and I am trying to get promoted to manager and this deal should enable me to do just that.
775	Thanks again for your comments to Dave.
775	Ben
776	Was that your harse realities of life speech.
776	I thought you were aa optimist just like myself.
776	I belive I actually should get a lot of credit and not just contribution for this deal.
776	It's not often an Associate helps crate $200 MM of value.
776	Have you checked out how much snow B.C.
776	has gotten recently and how much there about to get - its incredible.
776	This is going to be a great ski season.
776	Ben
777	I wonder why???

778	I will send you there presentation they have put together.
778	I will send via e-mail, so you will need to open up the document.

778	Ben
779	Here is the coal presentation.
779	Ben
780	Rebecca: I was just talking to Fred Mitro and he says you have put together a couple of different models on coal.

783	Yesterday he was in the PRC meetings all day and today is the Enron board meeting, where he is giving a presentation.
783	I did talk to Kay, his assistant, and he was planning on returning your call today.
783	Again, congrats on the release.
783	Ben
784	Dad: Congrats on the press release.
784	People that found out about it were amazed that we did it so quickly.
784	I was thinking, if you could call Ken, that would be great.
784	I know Michael is talking to Dave, but talking to Ken would really help my cause.
784	Let me know what you think.
784	I also am sending you a presentation that you will really enjoy.
784	Regards, Ben
785	How did you like the counter-party?
785	Ben
786	Thought you would be interested in this.
786	Seems to come at a time when Bushis going to win the Presidency - very interesting.
786	Ben
787	Rogers: Just wanted to meet up tomorrow for a few minutes to discuss some trading opportunities.
787	I think you said tomorrow at 3:30 pm would work for you.
787	Thanks!
787	Ben
788	Mitch: Just wanted to talk to you for a quick second about something we talked about this week.
788	Please give me a call and I'll come down.
788	Ben
789	Yeah right!
789	Nice try - Geek!
790	This pc has not been set up for it.
790	I'll get it set up soon.
790	Do you have aol?
790	Whats up?
791	What's up?
791	How's the week going?
791	Things are getting back to normal down here in Houston.
791	How's your brother doing - has he gone back to work?
792	What's up buddy?
792	How's school going?
792	Did you get this e-mail on the Dolan's?
792	Are we getting that old that our friends are beginning to have kids.
792	Say it ain't so!!
792	I am stillin shock over everything that happened last week.
792	I think our economy that is in for a beating for quit some time.
792	Our stock has gotten hammered.
792	The safe havens are the yield stocks.
792	Gotto go trade the power.
792	Talk to you later.
792	Ben
793	WIERD!!!
793	Someone has too much free time on their hands.
794	Carefull - Don't make me deny you of sex!!!
795	Dad: Let me know if you got the FedEx package I sent you yesterday.
795	It has some info I want to go through with you this weekend.
795	Also, I sent you Cliff's resume for you to look at so that you can give him a call with the hopes of hiring him for a finance position.
795	I'll talk to you soon.
795	Ben
796	Sorry it took so long to respond, but its been crazy around here.
796	Both KMI and KMP are still good buys, its just the overall market environment thats bringing these down.
796	Also, the commodities prices in gas and crude and fuel oil have come off quite a bit, which makes the general investors worry about the future earnings potential of the companies.
796	They are locked into contracts at a very good price, so whether the price of the commodity goes up or down they still make their cash flow targets.
796	Remember, the CEO of the company has a stack of over 25% of the company, so he is very tied to the overall stock price.
796	Enough said, invest your money into KMI and KMP, especially KMP since it has that yield of around 7%.
796	Talk to you soon.
796	Ben
797	Mr. Lay: It was good to see you down on the trading floor today.
797	I have been in the power trading group for about a year now.
797	I came over from the corp.
797	development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy.
797	I was the one who convinced my Dad to buy those two peakers.
797	The power trading group is a really solid group of individuals.
797	Sitting where I do I see and hear alot of what goes on in the heart on Enron and I feel that this part of the company is doing really well.
797	I have been with Enron for over four years now and I continue to learn alot as well as contribute to Enron's bottom line.
797	Eventhough Enron's stock price has come off a little I still think this is a great company and that the overall fundamentals are very sound.
797	I hope all is going well!
797	Regards, Ben
798	Thanks!
799	Dad: How do you like that?
799	Rumors are everywhere!!
799	Give me a call.
799	Ben

807	The day is not going so well!
807	I'll talk to you later.
808	Everyday that we are on the front cover of the journal our stock will go lower.
808	I have said this the past three weeks and everyday I have been right.
808	I think it could continue to go lower, because their is going to be no good news for a little while.
808	Getting access to cash from private equity firms is a double edge sword.
808	It doesn't look good for the small E.
809	I needed the CPN lifeboat three weeks ago.
809	This ship is going down, takeover soon or bankruptcy later.
809	No joke!
809	Let me check with Megan, but that sounds good.
809	Ben
810	Remember, those cannot be used for blackmail when I run for mayor of New York.
811	Michael: I think things begin to fall apart before X-mas.
811	Ben
812	David: Whats up?
812	I think tomorrow seems to be a big ax day over here for many of the groups in EIM and EGM.
812	It's getting pretty grim here on the trading floor.
812	Most people seem to think that this deal will not go through and that we will go into Ch.
812	7.
812	Trading has really slowed down.
812	How do things look over there?
812	Ben
813	The word is - the end is near.
813	Look for something soon.
813	Call me.
813	Ben
814	Whats your cell #?
814	I think I gave Mike Cyrus your home #.
814	I talked with him last night and he was going to give you a call.
814	Lets you and me try and talk today.
814	I have some material about these guys that you will appreciate.
814	Ben
815	Michael: Harry's cell phone number is (832) 723-6363.
815	I think I gave you his home number.
815	This number may be better to use to get in touch with Harry.
815	Ben
816	Sounds good.
816	11:30?
817	Sounds good!
818	Harry: Wanted to get your comments on your conversation with Michael.
818	I think it would be good if we put something together using the information I have combined with what you would like to show them.
818	Then think about going up there pretty soon.
818	Let me know what you think.
818	Ben
819	Michael: I just had another brief conversation with Harry.
819	He had not heard from Bruce yet.
819	I think coming down here sooner rather later would be important to get Harry and his team convinced.
819	Harry is talking to other folks and it seems that those talks are moving along quite quickly.
819	Hope this helps.
819	Ben
820	Harry: What did you think of the presentation thus far and what other type of info are you looking for.
820	The rest of the presentation is not that strategy oriented like the pages I gave you, but I will go through it and see if any of the other pages will help.
820	The key is to get an idea of what they are trying to do so that you can craft in that fashion.
820	I am playing tennis at 3:00, but will call you later to talk more about the presentation and tomorrow's meeting.
820	Ben
821	25 mw's is correct.
821	Thanks!
821	Ben
822	Ben
823	Unfortunately yes.
823	The traders and finance folks were kept on to perform unwind and liquidation functions.
823	The trading group, the group I am in, is really the only group with value besides the pipleines, thus we will probably be sold off to a bank like Citi or JPM.
823	I wouldn't mind that because they understand the trading business of commodities as well as equities and fixed income.
823	This as been an amazing experience and taught me alot about over leverage and strategic, really about what not to due, which can be as important as what to do in business.
823	99% of the folks are good hardworking people, but its the few finance guys at the top that brought this company down.
823	It really is a shame to see all these people yesterday get laid off.
823	It was so sad.
823	Luckily, by accident I had sold off most of my options last year, but still lost a little 401 k dough, but I still have my health as my mom likes to say.
823	On a good note we got your picture of the little tike, looks great.
823	I hope all is going well and thanks for the e-mail.
823	Talk to you soon.
823	Regards, Ben
824	sounds good.
824	see you there.
825	Sorry about that - I had to get a name and number from Mike for a guy at Goldman Sachs in New York, to arrange a potential meeting with those guys in NYC for a trading position.
825	I already paid $3,000 to ML today.
825	So its not an increase in Margin, plus you will write me a check for the current Margin balance tonight.
825	See you at home.
825	Ben
826	whenever - I am going to leave here pretty soon.
826	So whenever the best time for you is, just let me know.
826	Is the car ready?
827	yes!
827	I am going to go workout in a couple of minutes - talk to you layer.
827	I will be going up to Cinci a week from today.
827	Good discussions happened last night.
827	Ben
828	Yes - I think so.
828	I am still employed, just waiting to be bought out by a bank like Citigroup or UBS.
828	It's been crazy to live through all of this shit.
828	This has been an incredible learning experience of what NOT to do in business.
828	These guys at the top are complete crooks.
828	Anyway, enough bs, Megan and I are heading up to Boston for X-mas, were getting together with Jon and Kati one day.
828	Well be out in Colorado for New Year's.
828	I hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.
828	Thanks for the e-mail.
828	Ben
829	Joe: Thanks for the call.
829	My e-mail at work, which is fine to send it to, is benjamin.rogers@enron.com.
829	My e-mail at home is rogersofenron@yahoo.com.
829	I talked with Harry yesterday and he is bringing up with him all the resumes of the guys we are thinking about bringing over.
829	Do you want him to give them to McCabe or you or both when he is up there?
829	Maybe someone should give hime a call before that to have the resumes sent up there sooner.
829	I will send you and McCabe my resume today.
829	I look foward to coming up to Cincy Wednesday to talk to you guys about these opportunities.
829	Regards, Ben
830	Yes, thanks again for taking the time to arrange all this.
830	Talk to you soon.
830	Regards, Ben
831	Dad: Here is a quick stock analysis spreadsheet you should really get to use.
831	Call me if you have any questions or we can go through it when we are out there in Colorado.
831	Did you have a chance to meet with Harry?
831	I was suppose to come up, but some of the guys weren't available.
831	Ben
832	Missy: If you could change that to a taxi service, that would be great.
832	Since this is only a one day trip it's makes it a little easier for me.
832	Thanks again!
832	Ben
833	Dad: Cliff sent you his resume.
833	Cliff is the guy who is married to Megan's sister Dierdre.
833	They currently live in NYC.
833	He is looking to do corporate development type work with you guys in Cincy.
833	Let me know what you think.
833	I left a message for Brian Terp to send me his resume so I can send it to you.
833	Let me also know about your conversation with Michael about what we talked about yesterday.
833	Talk to you soon.
833	Ben
834	Eric: There is a book store called the Brown Book Store located several blocks from here.
834	They have several books on trading within this industry that you will want to read.
834	You will need to call information to find out where they are.
834	Good Luck!
834	Ben
835	Joe: Thanks for taking the time to talk with me regarding the opportunities at Cinergy.
835	I enjoyed my discussions with the other guys on the trading floor.
835	There is clearly money to be made trading in the right regions with the right people.
835	I would like to continue trading, but also learn Cinergy's assets to better understand how to effectively trade around these types of assets.
835	It seems that everyone I talked to is enthusiastic about growing the business in the right regions.
835	Let me know if you guys need me to come up and visit again.
835	Thanks again and I'll talk to you soon.
835	Regards, Ben
836	Dad: I thought the article was very poistive, but started out a little on the "good old boy" side.
836	You are operating in a political minefield very effectively.
836	Keep up the great work.
836	Talk to you soon and have a good week.
836	Ben
837	Your talk is cheap.
837	I sat next to your Dad all day yesterday at the KMI investor conference.
837	We had a good chat.
837	Talk to you soon.
837	Ben
838	Please tranfer my parking over to the Allan Center.
838	Please let me know what I need to due as soon as possible.
838	Thanks for the heads up.
838	Ben Rogers
839	Dave: I hope all is going well.
839	I left you an e-mail regarding coming over to work for you.
839	I decided to not except the UBS deal, so I wanted to come work for you and Janet.
839	Since I have already talked with these guys, I am pretty much available today going forward.
839	Again, you know what I have done and I think it would be a good fit.
839	Hope to hear from you soon.
839	Regards, Ben
840	I will call him today.
840	I have mover off the trading floor and I am actually back on 31st floor where we used to work in trading and origination.
840	Talk to you later.
840	Ben
841	Have you noticed where Cin Summer is trading lately???
841	Thats right around $37.5 to $38.0 That is lower than where it liquedated last summer and based on the fundamentals regarding gas, it looks like its heading lower than that by April.
841	Just wanted to keep you well informed and hope that your guys were in the right position.
841	It was a pretty violent price move these last several weeks.
841	Hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.
841	Ben
842	Dad: I heard that CIN summer is down to $32 - $33.
842	Gas is going to be below $2.00 for the summer by March.
842	Looks like your idea to short the whole year at $32.00 was a very good idea.
842	Again make sure your guys are looking at it right.
842	I think summer CIN will get to be around $28 before April and thats when you start buying it up.
842	Let me know what you think.
842	Merrill came out with a good report on you guys today.
842	I need to talk to you about a couple of things.
842	Please give me a call at home when you get the chance.
842	Ben
843	It all comes down to the rotten deal culture this place became.
843	I-banks have this kind of deal culture, but they seem to have the right controls in place, plus they are a lot bigger and the SEC is a clear watchdog in their dealings.
843	Ben
844	Excuse me!!!
844	You mean to say "what you learned in kindergarten" are the skills you need to have for the rest of your lifetime.
845	Rosanna: This most recent year I was in the power trading group for Enron working in the Northeast market, where I was a junior trader, but doing alot of senior trader type stuff.
845	I would be interested in talking with those guys if they are looking for someone like myself.
845	I know that most of the senior traders are staying with UBS.
845	There are a couple who have been looking elsewhere, some I think with Goldman.
845	Let me see where those guys are at.
845	I will send you my resume when I get home, so you will see it come through my home e-mail.
845	Thanks again and talk to you soon.
845	Ben
846	Rosanna: Sorry about not getting back with you.
846	I am actually out in Vail/Beaver Creek, working on my skiing, since now is a pretty good time to work on that.
846	I am still interested in talking with your contacts.
846	I will call you tomorrow morning.
846	I hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.
846	Thanks again for your patience and help with this issue.
846	Regards, Ben
847	Greg: I went to the meeting to look at valuing some of the outstanding contracts.
847	It will take some time to make sure that we have the correct forward prices on some of these contracts.
847	I will report back to you soon how all that is going and prepare written summaries to you asap.
847	Hope this helps under these specific circumstances.
847	Regards, Ben
848	you have way too much free time on your hands.
848	You maybe should be back in bed and not at work causing trouble between already troubled employees.
848	Nice art work!!
849	Paul: Up for playing spuash this week?
849	Ben
850	Billy: Good to see you back online.
850	Need to play some tennis before I leave.
850	I'll give you a call later.
850	Ben
851	Home e-mail:
852	sounds good.
852	Meet at the Briar Club?
853	yes - Otto's or Texadelphia
854	Dad: Did you see that Dynegy is spinning off a MLP called Dynegy Energy Partners.
854	Exactly what I have been talking about could be happening and that is still a very good idea, with maybe some of the players in your area.
854	Also, John Rowe as been named sole CEO and Chairman of Exelon.
854	They came out yesterday and said they were interested in merging with a midwest utility.
854	Talk to you soon.
854	Ben
855	Is this the Enron effect happening over there today?
855	Ben
856	Hey: Where do you think Delaney goes?
856	Goldman?
857	Stan: Its been a very interesting ride these last four and a half years here.
857	I received an offer from UBS, but decided to turn it down for personal reasons.
857	These last few weeks I have been with the estate working on selling certain assets.
857	Tomorrow is my last day with the estate and then I am off to Ohio and Cinergy to continue trading.
857	I will also begin to learn the oprations of Cinergy as well as go back and get an executive MBA at Chicago.
857	Ultimately, I want to learn more about the overall operations and effective energy risk management.
857	I just wanted to thank you for all you have done while I have been here.
857	I look back and think that I should have spent time in the pipeline group.
857	Even after all that has happened I certainly wouldn't change what I have experienced.
857	Thanks again for being such a good friend.
857	Hope you are doing well and good luck with everything.
857	I will send you my new information at Cinergy.
857	My Dad would love to hear from you sometime.
857	Regards, Ben

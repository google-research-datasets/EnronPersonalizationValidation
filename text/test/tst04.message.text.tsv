1	any opportunities for us?
1	Hunter
2	What is the latest on the EOL feeds.
2	I talked to Dave last week and he indicated it was no problem.
2	I have a meeting with him today at 2:30.
2	Let me know what I need to tell him.
2	Also, what is the latest with the late nominations.
2	I talked to Jason and he told him it was due to producers changing their noms.
2	I have not talked to George about this issue.
2	Jason also thinks that the problem is shorter lived that PGL&C has indicated.
2	Please write back with PGL&C's position on the matter.
2	Thanks Hunter
3	George, what is our view on this?
3	Hunter
4	You need to get a mountain bike.
4	I like riding the trails through Memorial Park.
4	Nasdaq 5000 here we come Hunter
5	I am glad to hear your search is going well.
5	It sounds like you are on the right track.
5	Hunter
6	I feel like such a heel.
6	There is a hidden pocket in my computer bag and I had placed my phone and flight info in this pocket.
6	Thank you for continuing to look for the phone.
6	I am embarrassed.
6	I had a meeting with Beth today.
6	I feel that it did not go well.
6	I asked for an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn the fundamentals.
6	I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group to learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the front-end.
6	She did not like that idea.
6	Her proposal is that an IT person can sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants front-end production to be handled by her group.
6	We ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.
6	It seems to me that if we don't have free access to the website or database, the group will suffer.
6	I will follow up tomorrow.
7	agreed
8	we will need to do it after work sometime.
8	Let me know Hunter
9	What is ETA and PA?
9	Thanks
10	can we create a link to a Chicago Hub EOL site?
10	If so, can the Chicago Hub site have new PA's and ETA's?
11	Dave can you redo with day + 1 products only?
11	Also can you display the data without placing multiple data in a given row?
11	I have attached an example.
11	The first row in this spreadsheet is how I would like to see the data.
11	This way I can sort the data in any fashion.
11	Thanks Hunter
12	I talked to Louise and she said that Mark Taylor had the following idea.
12	If the Chicago office signs an agreement that binds the Chicago office to every "Midwest Hub" deal on EOL then we could avoid the PA and ETA.
12	I believe the Chicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a problem.
12	Louise said that she would have someone call Laura Luce.
12	Laura manages the Chicago office and is the person that would authorize the above agreement.
12	Thanks Hunter
13	Laura Dave Forster from Eol may be calling you.
13	I am trying to get the Hub online and I am having trouble because Enron does not own more than 50% of the Midwest Hub.
13	An EOL lawyer may have found a solution.
13	I have asked Dave to call you.
13	I wanted to give you a heads up.
13	Thanks Hunter
14	Colleen What is XML?
14	Thanks Hunter
15	Donna What is the ANSI Compliance Team?
15	Thanks Hunter
16	Any more documentation on this deal?
16	Midwestern Gas Transmission 5/18/00 - Midwestern filed notice of a negotiated rate deal with Dynegy.
16	It provides for a monthly reservation charge of $.025/dth and a tiered indexed commodity rate based on spreads.
16	If the index spread is less than or equal to $.02, then the daily commodity rate shall be $.01.
16	If the index spread is greater than $.02 but less than $.10, then the rate shall be 50% of the spread.
16	If the index spread is greater than $.10, then the rate shall be $.05 plus 75% of the spread exceeding $.10.
16	The deal is effective 5/1/00 through 10/31/00.
17	next week sometime is possible.
17	not Tuesday Hunter
18	I have attached how I would do it.
18	check out the red comment marks.
18	Do not add day ahead + 1 I leave for Portland around 4:00 Thanks Hunter
19	Brad Today (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she must be profitable in the second half of the year.
19	I believe that my exact statement was "If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have another talk".
19	After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is probably too vague.
19	Do I need to clarify this statement?
19	Should I define the exact amount of profit?
19	Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to leave the group?
19	Your help would be appreciated.
19	Hunter
20	Before we publish this we need to calc the index for a few days.
20	We need to feel confident that the index is calculating correctly.
20	You can reach me at hunter
21	I think that if a product does not trade for a day, we do not post the product the index or product description in the index page.
21	I think the index calculation hours should be 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. How fast can the index page be calculated and posted?
22	I would like to see the composite.
22	I think my home computer has logon access through the firewall.
23	Has someone in NetWorks looked at this issue?
23	Thanks Hunter
24	I don't know if you read your email so I am forwarding this to you.
25	The page is missing the gas flow date and the numbers require only three decimal points.
25	We need to add Canada numbers.
25	Also is it possible to make the basis column more straight?
26	Should we have an explanation of index calculation?
26	It may build more trust in the numbers.
27	I think I have a meeting that starts at 4:00.
27	Please let them know that I can attend from 3:30-4:00.
28	Please call me (34772).
28	Where did you obtain your information?
28	Hunter
29	The first product looks good.
29	We need to consider having one product for parks and loans.
29	I think we should make a market in this product.
29	Let me know what you think.
29	Has Laura decided which organization will flip the deals?
30	where did you get your copy of Green Markets?
30	Hunter
31	EOL and Peoples
32	EOL and Peoples transaction explain year and quarter.
32	The biggest reason is EOL.
32	I think the month to date numbers are up because we are experiencing an increase in EOL trading in the Gulf Coast Region.
32	Let me know if you need more info.
32	Hunter
33	thanks
34	has anyone notified EOL of our flip-out choice.
34	I think the product would work like this: Chic - Peoples June one day withdrawal / July ratable injection .015 bid .025 offer Chic - Peoples June balance of month withdrawal / July ratable injection .015 bid .025 offer I think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a try.
34	Also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the Chicago office.
34	call me
35	The two canadian points (Dawn and Niagara) are quoted in US dollars so a basis can be calculated.
35	We also need to add NIT (AECO).
35	John McKay manages this product.
35	He should know the hours of trading and which day should be selected for index calculation.
35	Hunter
36	great
37	Chris, can you attend this?
38	can you attend this?
39	I am sad to see you go.
39	Stop by if you have time.

40	looks good.
40	I can not think of anything to add.
41	I will talk to her as well
42	Has the deal between you and Patrice been booked?
43	I don't remember if I told you that Fletch and I will be playing golf on Saturday morning.
43	Thank You Hunter
44	how did this go?
45	Tim I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.
45	This may help you prepare for Thursday.
45	Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.
45	The bulk of this production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.
45	In the winter, the US daily load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 55 BCF.
45	Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal differences in load.
45	Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.
45	However these states produce more gas than they consume.
45	Most other states consume more gas than they produce.
45	Therefore pipelines were built to solve the regional imbalances.
45	Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and move gas to the areas of greatest demand.
45	Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if the daily production is growing or shrinking.
45	Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.
45	Hunter
46	the guys are not listed
47	Sounds good....marty mare knows where to get them as well.

0	Ken, Please review the attached.
1	Renee, Did Sofregaz ask for these changes?
1	If so did they recommend this specific language?
2	David, Attached are the Sofregaz US Inc. contracts.
2	Thanks for your help on this.
3	Just received this.
4	Carol, I am interested in joining in on a group gift.
4	Let me know what you need.
5	Our risk manager has reviewed the insurance requirements.
5	His only comment concerned the Owner's/Contractor's Protective Liability Insurace requirement on the bottom of the first page of Exhibit E. He thinks this is unnecessary as we have adequate coverage under the General Liability and Excess Umbrella Liability.
5	Since this cost is likely to be passed on to us, we should waive this insurance requirement.
5	Everything else is OK from our perspective.
5	Let me know if you need any further information or have any questions.
6	Attached are a clean and redline version with my changes.
7	T-shirt size: X-large.
8	Trevor, I created an amendment to the Energy Services Agreement based on Paul's letter of April 19.
8	I think that this amendment is a much cleaner way to revised the Schedules to the Agreement.
8	Please review the amendment and schedules.
8	I revised the schedules further to make the base line calculations clearer.
8	If OK, lets fax a copy to Paul for his review before I prepare executables.
8	Let me know if you have any questions.
8	Note: We will also need to have a declaration of HPL and Managing Partner of HCC to review and approve this amendment.
8	Kevin Howard can sign and I have already prepared this document.
9	Fine by me.
10	I will be attending.
11	Larry, I made a few changes and filled in the blanks.
11	Please call me to discuss.
12	Please read the attached and respond.
13	Kay, Please review the attached data sheet and let me know if there are any problems.
13	Thanks.
14	FYI Attached is the latest Enron Compression Services Company structure.
15	Thanks for the quick response!
16	Hal, FYI, Attached is another form of O&M agreement specifically for offshore lines.
16	The structure of this agreement is different from our current deal, but the provided services in this form may be a good start for the Mariner O&M form.
17	Thanks for your help.
18	Attached is a draft Change Order for the Electric Drive Compressor Station.
18	Please review.
18	Specifically note the Compressor Contract Price Sheet and how Merrick Modified the Target Price definition.
18	Also I envision using this same format for the Dew Point Plant Change Order
19	Kay, Please review the attached data sheet and let me know if there any problems.
19	Thanks for your help.
20	Jordan, Attached is the latest structure.
20	This is still subject to change as AA has not yet approved.
20	The deal basically involves creating a new entity to take ownership of 2 existing Electric Compressor Motor Drivers and associated contracts which ECT currently owns.
20	The compressor motor drivers are supplied with electricity from the Navajo Tribal Utiltity Authority (NTUA).
20	ECT sells horsepower created by the motor drivers to Transwestern in exchange for $$ and MMBtus.
20	Lance Schuler will be working the finance portion of this project.
20	This is a 2nd Quarter deal.
20	Would you expect anything less?
20	Please let me know who will be working on this from your group or call to discuss any questions.
20	Thanks.
21	Attached is a short outline of the proposed steps to transfer the Compressor Motors, NTUA Contract, and TW Contracts to ECS LLC.
21	I know we still don't have structure approval, but I can begin working on the documentation for those items that will not likely change (the transfer of assets and contracts).
21	Please review and let me know of any issues or problems.
22	How about 10 a.m.?
23	EB3883.
23	See you tommorrow.
24	Ted, Attached is a revised draft of a letter.
24	Please review and let me know if you have any comments.
24	Please note the following with respect to this issue: 1.
24	We should make sure we have performed a gas analysis at each producers delivery point and are sure they are creating or contributing to the quality problem.
24	I recommend attaching such gas analysis to this letter.
24	2.
24	The BRG Petroleum Corp. contract doesn't give us any cause to send this letter.
24	The contract requires BRG to meet the quality specs.
24	of the the pipeline which receives the gas downstream of the Point of Delivery on the Confirm.
24	Such Point of Delivery is at the wellhead and HPL is the downstream pipe.
24	HPL's specs (unless they have changed, don't have a limitation on gas richness).
24	3.
24	The Texlan letter will be slightly modified from the attached, since we will reference Force Majeure.
24	4.
24	Do we have a accurate list of producer names and address?
24	If you are okay with the letter, I can have a paralegal prepare the letters with addresses.
25	Lal, Attached is the form agreement that was attached as Exhibit B to the LLC Agreement.
25	Have you reviewed the Change Order form for the Compressor and Plant?
25	I have not heard back from Andy either.
25	Please let me know if you have any comments.
26	Mark, The attached document outlines the relevant documents to be assigned to the new LLC and their assignment provisions.
26	Please note that for the City of Farmington Power Supply Agreement (Bloomfield), a deposit will be required by the new assignee.
26	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
26	Larry and Lance, The contract packages which contain the referenced agreements will be sent today.
27	Attached is a draft form of Master Firm Purchase Agreement between ECS Compression Company, L.L.C.
27	as Seller and ECS as Buyer.
27	Also attached is a confirm for the gas deal.
27	Notice the information I need on the confirm and please fill in the blanks.
27	If you have any comments on the contract form, please let me know as soon as possible.
28	Attached for review are the following: 1.
28	Bill of Sale for Bloomfield Electric Motor (ECT to ECS) 2.

30	Thanks.

31	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
32	Per Ted Bland's request attached is our PSA for the Nacogdoches Gathering System.
33	Mark, Please review the attached form of amendments.
33	I have also prepared the form of amendment for the O&M Agreements, but will hold until you get further information on the fee arrangements.
33	After you review these forms, lets discuss and review where we are at in this whole process.
33	We will need to get TW, Accounting, and Investor review of these as soon as possible.
34	Forgot to put you on the original distribution.
35	Jaime, Attached is a firm sales agreement form which ECT utilizes in North America.
35	A lot of the form may not be relevant given the fact that (i) Pemex is both the seller and transporter and (ii) unless you are near the border, there are no alternative sources to Pemex.
35	However, it is a good starting point.
35	Let me know if you have any questions.
36	Attached is a draft of the Contractor Protocols which work with the services agreements of Hanover Measurement Services Company (Stone Entity) which were circulated by Mary Cook last week.
36	Please review in conjunction with the services agreements and provide comments
37	Here they are.
38	Paul, I am still here.
38	Where the heck are you?
38	I guess you are back in the States by now.
38	What are you guy's up to?
38	How many kids do you have now?
38	As for Lisa and I, we are still DINKs (Double Income No Kids) in Houston.
38	I am officially an attorney now working in the corporate legal department of Enron Capital & Trade Resources.
38	I had to turn in my pocket protector when I left my engineering job.
38	Lisa actually just joined Enron, so now it is all in the family.
38	We are doing good.
38	We bought a 50 yr old house near downtown about 1 year ago and have been restoring it ever since.
38	It really is amazing how all that Bob Villa watching is now paying dividends.
38	I am considering getting a tool belt with my name engraved on it.
38	We are both doing good.
38	Life for me is good, now that I don't have to go to school in the evening or study for the bar exam.
38	I am just enjoying my free time now.
38	I still keep up with George and Ernie occasionally.
38	George still lives in Austin and is single.
38	I visit him a couple of times a year.
38	You wouldn't believe it.
38	He still has the same furniture in his apartment that he had in college.
38	Kind of like stepping into a time warp.
38	Ernie just finished getting his MBA at UT this spring.
38	He will be working in San Antonio for Frito Lay (no doubt designing a chip that won't break when you dip it).
38	He now has a little girl with another kid on the way.
38	I think due sometime this summer.
38	He has really changed since undergrad.
38	A responsible young man now.
38	How are Mom and Pop Bieraugel doing?
38	(Is the Big 10 going to take it in the shorts this year?) Are they still in the Washington area?
38	Lisa had talked to your mom about a year ago when she was trying to track you down for my graduation party.
38	Sounded like all was well in the Bieraugel household.
38	I think she said John was in Alaska?
38	Anyway, drop me a note when you get a chance.
38	It is really great to hear from you again.
38	We need to keep in touch.
38	Gerald,
39	Steve, We are currently negotiating an interconnect agreement for an upgrade of an existing interconnect off the Trawick System into TUFCO.
39	The interconnect is solely a delivery to TUFCO.
39	We are down to one point of difference in the agreement.
39	Typically HPL disclaims any liability for consequential damages to the other party.
39	TUFCO is asking for an exception for any violation of gas quality specifications.
39	This would mean that if HPL delivered off spec gas to TUFCO which required cleanup of their pipeline system or caused damage to a customer of TUFCO's HPL would be liable under this Agreement.
39	From a legal standpoint, we can make this exception, but I wanted to make sure everyone understood and agreed with the acceptance of this potential liability.
39	Assuming we are properly monitoring all our receipts there shouldn't be an issue.
39	Please let me know what you think about this situation.
39	I can forward a copy of the interconnect agreement if you do not currently have one.
40	I don't know if you have been keeping up with the recruiting info but Mack has committments from 4 blue chippers already.
40	One of them is the top LB in Arizona.
40	He is working his magic again this year.
41	I haven't heard anything about the status of those recruits, except that it sounds like Alfio Randall will be a partial qualifier.
41	This isn't great since we need OL for depth this year.
42	TUFCO has agreed to remove the exception to consequentials for breach of quality provisions.
42	They are preparing executables and will forward to HPL for execution.
42	Thanks for your help.
43	Tom, I would like to attend lunch.
43	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
44	Here they are.
44	Please review.
45	Attached are the revised O&M Agreement Amendments with the new fee structure.
46	The change order #4 for the compression was Fedexed to Ralph Townsend today.
46	I am holding Change Order #5 the Dew Point Plant until we have the specifications.
46	Let me know if you have any questions.
47	Cris, For the sake of completeness, attached is the form of gas purchase agreement and confirm with the $10 million prepayment between ECC and ECS.
47	The pricing has not been input yet.
47	The gas purchase agreement between ECS and ECT would be a mirror of this one.
48	Elizabeth, The Duns number for Enron Compression Services Company is 072773547.
48	I will be completing the Agency Agreement this afternoon and will forward to you.
48	Also I faxed the corporate data sheet for the company to you yesterday.
48	Let me know if you need anything else.
48	Thanks for your help.
49	Thanks for the quick turnaround!
50	Brian, Do you know how quick D&B would have data entered into this system?
50	We need to move this as fast as possible.
51	Attached is the revised Schedule I to the Bisti Compression Services Agreement Amendment.
51	Please replace the existing Exhibit with this one.
51	If you have any questions, please call me at x-33512.
51	Thanks for your all help in getting these done timely.
52	Here is the link to the Enchantment Resort.
53	Please review.
54	Kay, Please see attached.
54	Thanks
55	Mark, Attached are the confirms for both the ECS purchase and the ECT purchase.
55	Please take one last look.
55	If OK I will forward the ECS purchase to Porter and Hedges.
55	The ECT confirms still have the TW West Texas Pool as being the point at which ECT takes title.
56	Paula would be fine for me.
57	Ken Pearson, Attached is revised facilities agreement reflecting a small change in the design of the station.
57	Please review and let Cheryl Marshall know if it is acceptable asap.
57	We will replace that page in the originals and execute and forward one to Celanese.
57	The revised section are underlined and highlighted.
57	Cheryl will also be faxing revised exhibits to the agreement for your review.
58	Mark, Please review the attached letter and provide the missing date.
58	If everything looks good, I will prepare an original for your signature.
58	Also, do you have any resolution on the TW transport issue?
58	Is it acceptable for ECT to take title at the West Texas Pool and ECS still operate the transport agreement as its agent?
59	I didn't find any wells in this file.
59	Looks like you inadvertantly attached the wrong file.
60	Dennis, Per Elizabeth Brown's request, I am providing the following information about Enron Compression Services Company Address: 1400 Smith St. Houston, Texas 77002 Commercial Contact: Mark Courtney (x-36368) Credit Contact: Bill Bradford (x-33831) Let me know if you need any further information.
61	Attached is a draft of the Master Firm Purchase Agreement between ECS (Seller) and ECT (Buyer) with a confirm for Bisti and Bloomfield.
61	These mirror the Master Firm Purchase and confirms between ECC (Seller) and ECS (Buyer).
61	Please review.
61	Per our discussion yesterday, ECT will take title at the West Texas Pool and transport off of TW under the existing transport contract between TW and ECT.
61	Mark, I wasn't sure who needed to see this on ECT's commercial side, so please forward to whomever is appropriate.
62	Susan, Attached are redlined copies of the CSA Amendments.
62	We made a change to the Monthly Contract Quantity to exclude Force Majeure events and Section 2.4 Shaft energy interruptions.
62	Please review and call me with any questions.
62	x-33512.
62	Since we have circulated the prior amendment, I think it would avoid the most confusing by giving these amendments a new execution date.
62	I also added a section which specifices that these versions replace the amendments dated The NBV letter values will also be redone.
62	The numbers will have to be changed.
62	The investors have asked that instead of a Contract Year Schedule, a quarterly schedule be included.
62	I don't have the numbers from Mark yet, but will forward those changes as soons as I get them.
62	Mark indicated that he had discussed these changes with both you and David.
63	Attached are clean and redline versions.
64	Susan, Attached the revised net book value letters.
64	The numbers have increased.
64	Also they are now specified quarterly.
65	Trevor, Please review the spreadsheet and let me know if you agree.
65	The number in bolds are the values pulled from the existing TW net book value letter agreements
66	Susan, Attached are the letter agreements between ECS and TW which cover the earlier letters I sent.
67	Attached is a redline of the Bisti Assigment documents showing the latest revision.
67	The sames changes have been made in all 4 assigments.
67	Also attached is the Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Agreement with Confirms and Redlines of the Confirms to show the lastest changes.
67	Please contact me at (713) 853-3512 if you have any questions
68	Pat, the specific representation is in section 3.02(v).
68	If you could get back to as soon as possible.
68	We are executing these documents tommorrow.
68	I am basically trying to make sure the Enron Compression Services Company can make this rep.
68	given our circumstances.
69	Attached is a redline of the Bisti Assignment in Contribution Agreement (ECC to ECS).
69	This version picks up a change in the indemnity section that was missed in the version e-mailed earlier.
69	This change will be made in all 4 Assignment and Contribution Agreements.
70	In Section 7 Indemnity in the first sentence, after the words "causes of action" I added suits, awards, liabilities, fines, costs, fees, expenses.
70	This was missed earlier.
71	Attached are the revised June 30, 1999 Amendments to the Compressor Service Agreement both Bisti and Bloomfield which supersede the June 18, 1999 amendments.
71	Redlines are also attached to show the changes from prior versions.
71	Also attached are revised TW payout amount letters date June 30, 1999 which supersede the June 18, 1999 letters.
71	All were executed late today and will be distributed in the morning.
71	However, in the interest of time, I am distributing these now for your information.
72	This is incredible.
72	The kid was a life long Aggie Fan, makes one trip to Austin and commits to UT.
72	I think we have finally found the guy to win it all for us (MB).
72	Also now Chance is saying he will actively recruit for us.
72	He wants this years class to be better than last years class.
72	I think a few phone calls to Roy Williams and BJ Johnson.
72	I can't wait til August.
72	When are you coming back guy.
72	Are you ready for some football?
73	Might try this for the bar, while at the bar.
74	Paul, We need to plan on getting together sometime.
74	When and how long are you going to be in San Diego once you get back from stomping out the "angry red horde"?
74	Might be an opportune time to hook up.
74	I would love to see Papa Bieraugel in action and I'm not referring to your Dad.
75	Not sure if you or someone in your group already had seen this.
76	The form of right of way looks good.
76	Go ahead and forward to the land owner.
77	What's up rude-dog.
77	Haven't heard any new recruiting news.
77	I think it is going to be quiet on that front until later in the football season.
77	I was up in Denver this past week and talked to Jessica Wentworth.
77	She said you have been exploring the Australian countryside.
77	Bet there is some amazing stuff down under.
77	Anyway, drop me a note and let me know how its going.
77	I know I have asked this before, but when are you getting into town?
77	We need to have some repatriation beers upon your arrival.
78	Things are going good in legal.
78	I am getting to work on some interesting stuff.
78	I just finished working on a compressor deal with Mark Courtney.
78	It was an asset and finance deal.
78	I got to work with the finance commercial and legal types and learn quite a bit in a very short time.
78	It is hard to keep up with the pace and not make a total fool of myself with my lack of knowledge at this point.
78	Tense but fun.
78	I didn't see the any of the high school all star games.
78	I heard Babers and Turner both looked very good in the Texas- California game.
78	Sounds like they were covering some 6'5" bad asses from California and pretty much shut them down. At least that most other peoples opinion. Sounds like Kenny Hayter look pretty good. Leading Texas rusher. He sounds like a power runner not a real juker. I am really worried about the NC State game. It would suck to lose the home opener, but I think that is a very real possibility. Their quarterback sounds like a stud and they have some big recievers, ala UCLA. I still think we will at least go 7-4 probably 9-2 best case. Your right though. If we fall flat with 5-6 or something it will slow the momentum Mack is building. I just don't think that will happen. Mack is too smart and can really get these kids to overchieve. I think his players believe and are motivated to play hard. Mackovic only won with offensive schemes and good athletes like James Brown. When you think about it though, Mack following Mackovic is really going to pay dividends in the long run. Mack Brown and Greg Davis weren't exactly known for their high powered offense at UNC. But Mackovic had installed a strong passing game and quarterbacks which Mack and Greg picked right up on. Now we have kids like Mock, Williams, and Johnson wanting to come here for the offensive scheme alone. I like it. It is going to be fun in about 2 years with the quality of kids we are now getting. I will think about the groups I have worked with and let you know on any areas to go. I have worked a lot with Larry Lawyer in the finance group and know he is looking work people. I don't know if this was the same stuff you did in Denver or the same group. Might be. Those guys do work a lot of hours. Almost as bad as attorneys. I will give it some thought. Well, all for now. Keep in touch. I am glad you are going to be back in Houston. We will have some fun. I want to hear all about how much you really like Australian women or more specifically, how much they like you.
79	I Love You!
80	A note from Bieraugel.
80	We need to go out and see these guys when we get a chance.
80	Hang in there.
80	Things will start to come around, it is just going to take some time.
81	Thought you might find the attached interesting.
81	I don't know if any of the people you are talking to are on this list, but might be worth checking.
82	Jackie, Could you have the Entex Contract the Mike mentions pulled and forwarded to me.
82	Thanks.
83	Ken, Attached is the form of ROW Agreement and Exhibit B that goes along with it.
84	Greg, Attached is a draft of interconnect agreement form based on the discussion we had yesterday.
84	I left the reimbursement provision open with only placeholder language that indicated they will be paying for the interconnect in some form.
84	I made some assumptions about equipment that either party would install, however this can easily be changed.
84	I didn't draft any credit language in the agreement.
84	I think this would be best handle by simply having our credit department review these guys and if they are worried about them, we should require them to make an upfront payment before we buy or build anything.
84	Take a look at the draft and let me know if you have any questions.
85	Tommorrow at 2:00 or later works for me.
85	Thanks
86	Works for me.
86	Thanks.
87	Mark, I made the change in attached note.
87	Let me know if you need anything else.
88	I am glad you asked me to lunch today.
88	I do enjoy spending time with you even though at times it is tough and our conversations are hard right now.
88	I do Love You so much and have a Vision.
89	Dan, Attached are clean and redlined versions with the changes we discussed yesterday.
89	Please review the exhibits on both documents one last time.
90	Ken, Attached is a revised draft of the Hanover Agreement based on all our discussions to date.
90	Please review.
90	I would prefer one more internal review prior to forwarding to Hanover.
90	Please note where information is still needed concerning the specific units for the schedule forms.
90	Sorry for the delay.
91	Greg, I have never been to a tasting before.
91	Will there be some small foods to go along with the wine?
91	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
92	Dan, Attached are clean and redlined versions incorporating the modified suggested Kennedy revisions we discussed.
92	Please review.
92	I will revised the Independant contracts later this afternoon.
92	I will also send you a form purchase and sale agreement for the Independant gathering facilities.
93	Here are some names.
94	I sent in the admission fees, so hope you still want to go.
95	Dan, Attached are the latest independent docs with the Collection Facilities funding, construction, and fee structure.
95	I am working on a form a construction agreement which will be attached as an Exhibit to the Field Services Agreement.
96	Dan, Attached are the Field Services and Purchase Agreement with the changes we discussed.
96	As we further discussed, there will be a letter agreement between Independent and Neidigger (??) which gives independent the right to produce and market his gas in accordance with the terms of the attached agreements.
96	Do you have Niedigger real name and type of entity?
97	Please review and forward to IPC.
97	This will be required to commit Niedigger gas to our purchasing and field services agreements.
98	Here it is.
98	Please revise as necessary.
99	David, Attached is a construction agreement draft for a $750,000 gathering system between Sapphire Bay.LLC (of which ECT, Jedi II, and Independent are members) and Independent as contractor.
99	Sappire Bay will own the gathering system.
99	Please give me a call to discuss.
100	Paul, Attached is the draft of the Agreement for your review.
101	Ken, Attached is a redline that might make your review easier.
101	I didn't want to forward this one to Hanover.
101	Let me know if you have any questions.
102	Attached is a redline with the changes we discussed.
102	Please review and if it looks OK, please forward to Susan and Dave.
103	The latest and greatest including form of construction agreement.
104	Lillie, You might try checking with Jack Simunek.
104	I am not sure there is any documentation on this, but he has a pretty good handle on this issue.
104	Jim Coffey at one time issued a one page memo on just this subject.
104	Might also check with him.
104	Once we decide whether to apply this or not, putting this into a contract is a relatively simple matter.
105	Any chance they could email electronic version of this Agreement?
106	Attached is LOI with our revisions redlined.
106	Please review and call either Mark or myself to discuss.
107	Here it is.
108	Dan, Attached are the lastest turns of Kennedy.
108	Let me know if you or Kennedy have questions.
109	Lisa, It is extremely hard to watch you struggle through this.
109	It is hard for me also.
109	I sit up here trying to work when the reality of our current situation weighs on me like a ton of bricks.
109	It is hard for me not to break down a couple of times a day, but the pace of my work usually forces me through those times.
109	I don't know if my calling you, asking you to lunch, or holding your hand, helps or hurts at this time.
109	But I am not going to let us give up on each other.
109	My feelings for you run too deep to just try and bury them so that I don't have to think about all the pain.
109	We are both struggling to find a place to start.
109	I want to start by just letting you know that not a day goes by without me thinking of a time when we can put this behind us.
109	I am not sure how to get there right now either.
109	However, during those few precious time lately when I get to look into your eyes, I see the true Lisa (changed as she is by the last couple of years), but still Lisa nonetheless.
109	I need to get to know this changed true Lisa, whatever happens in the near future.
109	I felt I just to had to write this email.
109	Gerald
110	Brian, Attached is a draft of the termination letter.
110	The letter assumes the letter agreement was executed.
110	There also appears to be an agency agreement which appointed Merrick as agent for ROW acquisition.
110	This is also terminated by the letter.
110	I haven't heard from Shonnie yet.
110	Please review and add any comments you have.
110	Thanks
111	David Marshall (ECT risk management) insurance review.

111	I will contact Lyn Bellenhausen tosee if she anticipated a pipeline project in the original LLC insurance requirements.
112	Attached are David's comments.
112	The gathering facilities that Independentwill be constructing (in their individual corporate capacity) are valued atapproximately $750,000.
113	G, How is it going?
113	Been a while since we spoke.
113	What have you been up to?
113	As for me, just a lot of work and little vacation worked in there.
113	Nothing real exciting.
113	Finally finished the redo of that damn kitchen.
113	I don't think I will be undertaking any home repair projects on my own anytime soon.
113	I am having Austin withdrawals and need to get back real soon.
113	It won't be long now though for football.
113	Sounds like Redding and Sims look pretty good in practices so far.
113	That first game makes me nervous.
113	NC State is a pretty good passing team and we may have freshman cornerbacks starting.
113	Now for the real subject.
113	Tailgating.
113	How is it shaping up this year?
113	Same place, cold beer, good food.
113	I am definitely coming in for the NC State game.
113	Lisa may or may not be with me.
113	Don't know yet.
113	Anyway I will be glad to contribute to the cause.
113	Drop me a note when you get a chance and fill me in.
114	Dan, Attached are the 1st drafts.
115	Dan, Please disregard the prior draft and use this one.
116	GT, The theme of the party sounds excellent.
116	What time is the party on Friday and where does the boat leave?
116	I may take a day of vacation.
116	I have more than I can probably use this year.
117	See attached word doc.
118	FYI
119	Greg, Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Gateway Interconnect Agreement.
119	Please review before forwarding to Pace to make sure the ownership concept is in accordance with your negotiations.
119	Please call me if you have any questions and I will forward the Rio Nogales later today.
120	Attached is the draft interconnect agreement.
121	Dan, Attached are the drafts with the revisions we discussed.
121	Both clean and redlined against prior version.
122	Here they are.
122	Enjoy.
122	Call me to go over a few points before we forward to Denise.
123	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
124	Greg, Attached is a draft settlement and release agreement for the Westfield #1.
124	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
124	Note, the adjusted invoice is to be attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement.
125	GT, I will be taking Friday off.
125	Probably drive in Friday morning or early afternoon.
125	What are your plans that day?
125	If you need any help setting up or anything let me know.
126	Mark, I added Paragraph 3 in Article II to cover any obligations which ECS incurs for the drive and WT1.
126	Please review and if OK I will forward to Susan for her review.
127	Would you please stop wetting your cube and blaming it on me!
128	Dan, Attached are the documents with my revsions.
128	Let me know if you have any questions.
129	Please disregard the version I sent about 30 minutes prior and use these.
130	Dan, Attached are the drafts with the Collection Facilities language.
130	Blank exhibits for the Security Agreement Form and Insurance requirements.
130	Will forward as soon as I am able to obtain them.
130	Let me know if you have any questions.
130	Dan, Could you ask Denise if all the Lease Agreement are the same form.
130	If not, I need to see all of them.
131	Tony, The following steps follow the contract amendment (assumes Bloomfield contract): 1.
131	Calculate the number of hours that the driver was down for force majeure.
131	2.
131	Subtract the hours in #1 from the total hours in the month.
131	3.
131	Calculate the Monthly Contract Quantity as defined in the amendment (Bloomfield -- 7000 times # of hours developed in #2 above) 4.
131	Calculate the Load Factor as defined in the agreement.
131	Since we don't have a load factor during those hours of the Force Majeure Event, we assume that the unit would have run at the load factor in #4 above if not for the Force Majeure event.
131	Thus, 5.
131	Multiply the Load Factor times 7000 (max HP-hrs) times # of hours of force majeure event.
131	This gives you the equivalent HP-hours that would have been used during the Force Majeure event or Supply Interruption.
131	6.
131	In accordance with the amended Section 3.2(a), to calculate HP-hour charge do the following: Multiply Conversion Factor (taken from Exhibit based on load factor) times (Shaft Energy delivered + Equivalent HP-hours during Force Majeure [this is the number calculated in #5 above]) times 1.031.
131	Let me know if you have any questions.
131	We can work through an example if we need to.
131	Thanks.
132	I know love isn't enough by itself.
132	We have to give each other more.
132	The types of things that make the other feel full and complete in life.
132	We have focused on material things, when really more meaningful things, such telling the other that you have an interesting way of looking or thinking about some facet of life are what fills each other.
132	We are both bright and ambituous people who should be able to enjoy the finer things in life, but in the right context.
132	Not as direction, but as background to connecting as husband and wife.
132	Husband and wife means many things; friends, supporters, providers, sounding boards, lovers, shoulder to cry on, someone to just hold onto, or walk hand in hand on the beach.
132	I want to do these things for you and want you to do them for me.
132	Hope you can think of me.
132	Love, Gerald
133	Denise, Attached is the agreement with changes redlined.
133	Please review and call me if you have questions.
133	(713) 853-3512
134	Thought you might be interested.
134	Just in case you aren't recieving these emails.
135	Has the few changes we discussed.
136	Meant to copy you on this.
137	Here it is.
138	David, Please review the attached document, specifically Section 6.7.
139	Attached are the changes we discussed today.
140	Rude Dog, Maverick, It's no good up here.
140	I'm holding on too tight.
140	I've lost the edge.
140	Yes, it is close.
140	I am pretty pumped.
140	I am also extremely nervous about Barnette and their passing game.
140	Looks like Walker and Hill will be the starting corners.
140	Yikes!
140	I think our defense will be able to put some pressure on Barnette with the type of speed we have at linebacker now.
140	If we don't get any pressure on Barnette, I think we will likely lose this game.
140	But I am hopeful that big Shaun Rogers will wreak havoc in the middle.
140	The offense is still a big questions.
140	The level of talent on the OL gives me comfort.
140	Davis, Kirk-Hughes (so big they gave him two names), Roesler, etc. are all big time.
140	The 1st series should be really interesting.
140	I think we come out passing lights out to loosen up the run defense.
140	Then start sending Ike off Roesler and Davis.
140	Occasionally send Flowers down the field on the fly and have Applewhite throw it as far as he can.
140	It is going to be a good one.
140	Which game is the first one you'll be able to go to?
140	How are the Australian women?
140	Bring pictures and stories.
140	Preferably with much embellishment.
141	I recieved both documents.
141	Thanks.
142	Attached are the revised gas purchase and gathering agreement and the new Collection Facilities Agreement.
142	The Collection Facilities Agreement has the insurance requirements but not the Security Documents.
142	I will forward the Security Doc.
142	shortly.
143	Attached is the security document form.
143	Section 5.4 is missing and I will provide tommorrow.
143	However, in the interest of time I am forwarding the agreement for review.
144	GT, I will be coming to this game w/o Lisa.
144	I plan on driving in Friday night and probably getting there about 9:00 pm.
144	If its okay I'll crash at your place.
144	Let me know how your schedule looks.
144	Since Lisa isn't coming I'll have an extra ticket with me on the 35.
144	Interested?
145	This version includes the Section 5.4 language.
146	Attached is a clean and redline version of the documents.
146	I have the Powder River Basin Exhibit and can fax if you want to review.
146	Please note that I added a section that allows Enron to relocate units if they are underutilized at their current location.
146	This was resultant of the 5 year term for the units contracted for during the initial 2 year period.
147	Attached are the executable documents
148	Bob, Please print out 2 copies and have Hanover execute.
148	Please fax signature today to me at (713) 646-3490 and FEDEX or Courier complete contracts to me at: 1400 Smith Thanks for your help.
149	G, I will be there about 9 pm tonight.
149	My cell phone # is 281-772-9250
150	I am fedexing the form of lease this morning.
150	Sorry for the delay.
151	Oooouch!
151	That one hurt.
151	We really kicked their butt all over the field.
151	The defense played well, especially Ahmad Brooks.
151	I don't think he had one completed on him all night.
151	What really sucks is that we just gave this game away with the punting team.
151	I am trying not to get too down about this.
151	This is a young team that is going to make mental errors and they will improve.
151	I still thinks we will have a good season.
151	The only freshman I saw getting any PT was Cory Redding.
151	He looks fast out there and really crushed somebody on a kick off return.
151	He also got some snaps at DE on a couple of 3 and longs, but didn't do anything outstanding.
151	Unfortunately he was also out there on the punt team during the debacles.
151	Victor Ike should be our starting tailback.
151	He look big and fast and gets yardages running in the interior.
151	Ike left a defender looking really stupid on his long TD run.
151	Sweet moves.
151	Hodges look about like he did last year.
151	Had a couple of good runs but doesn't seem to use his blocking very well.
151	OK, so we will begin our win streak with Stanford.
151	The thing I really like was that Mack said he takes full responsibility for the punting problems and that he will insure that they get fixed.
151	Mackovic would have made excuses that essentially put the blame elsewhere.
151	This season could be an up and down one, but the real prize is next year and the years after.
151	Did you get any info on the game?
152	I was thinking of bringing along a friend from Enron to the boat party.
152	Unfortunately he is not a female so this may throw off your proper party ratio.
152	He is married though so he will leave the single girls alone for you and me.
152	His wife is out of town this weekend.
152	He won't mind sleeping on the floor.
152	Thanks for letting me hang at your place this weekend.
152	Lisa is a really cool girl.
152	You two will have fun together.
153	Attached are the latest versions.
153	Call me if you have any questions (713)
154	Mark, Attached are the letter agreement and Purchase and Sale Agreement.
154	Please review.

156	Attached is a revised LOI for WT1.
156	I took out all the language concerning materials and equipment obligations incurred by ECS.
156	After talking with Knippa, I understand that after the sale of the motor to TW, they will be doing all of the installation.
156	Please review and provide comments.
157	No problem.
157	I will review these and get back with Cheryl.
157	Thanks.
158	I am not sure if these letter were sent out yet or not.
158	My only comment would be to add an effective date of the name change from HPLR to HPLC and ECT to ENA.
158	The latter is effective Sept.1, 1999.
158	If you have any questions, please contact me a x33512.

162	My new email info.
163	Just working on a Courtney deal while thoughts of you pop into my head.
163	One of the things I really love about you is how humble you are.
163	You are beautiful, confident, and intelligent, and yet you don't act like you know that.
163	I sincerely have always felt lucky to be with you.
164	Terry, Attached is a PSA form we have used before with the perspective of Enron as buyer.
164	Probably a little more detailed than we need for this one since the facilities are only estimated at $200,000.

164	is Buyer.
164	Some further detail on the site lease agreement: CounterParty is Black Hills Trucking, Inc Initial 1 year term, then month to month up to 2 years total Fee $800/month Black Hill will provide phone and electricity service hookup and Enron to reimburse Enron will directly pay phone and electricity bills Area is approximately 250 ft.

166	Rude-Dog, Are you there?
167	GT, Great party.
167	Looking forward to the next one already.
167	I think I left my cell phone charger in your apartment on your table.
167	If I did, just hold it.
167	I'll be back for Rice and pick it up then.
167	If not, I must have lost the damn thing somewhere else.
167	Later, G$
168	From the Oklahoma 100: "Waylon Turdsby, star TE from the reigning 3-A champion Fighting Chick-Peas gave the Sooners a verbal commitment by letter late Wednesday according to OK100 sources. This is a big boost to the Sooners who were competing with Tulsa, Anadarko Junior College and out of state powerhouse Kansas for his services. Waylon, who is 6'2", 218lbs and runs a 4.75 40 chose OU because "They serve fried pork rinds in the cafeteria and the chicks there dig mullet hairdos".
168	Waylon plans to study business and eventually take over the family used car dealership.
168	Waylon added "My daddy says he has done a lot of business with Sooner coaches and boosters over the years and that OU would be the best place to refine my used car selling skills."
168	The great traditions of OU were also a factor according to Waylon, "They have this great tradition where they touch all the movie posters of OU legend Brian Bosworth before running out onto the field. You just don't get that kind of inspiration outside of OU."
169	Attached is a discussion draft of the Compression Services Agreement for Gallup.
170	Mary, I was out of the office on Friday and unfortunately have a conflicting meeting scheduled.
170	Please let me know what we need to do to work out the details.
171	The operations information you requested should now be directed to Robert Morgan in Facility Planning.
171	I forwarded the sheets you left in my office last week to Robert for his review.
171	I handled this request before when I was in Facility Planning, but Robert has now taken my place.
171	Shonnie Daniel will work with you from the Legal Group perspective to give you any help you need.
172	Tom, Attached is the Right of Way Services Agreement we discussed Friday.
172	I would like to thank you and Mark for meeting with us on short notice.
172	We look forward to working with you.
173	Ken, Attached is the Black Hills Trucking lease agreement.
173	Please review to make sure it correctly captures your deal with Black Hills.
173	I am still reviewing from a legal perspective, so please do not forward until we have talked further.
174	That is hilarious.
174	You know it is a good party when you make the news.
174	Just talked to Ernie.
174	He didn't have your new email and work #.
174	He is planning on coming up for the Rice game.
174	You should be hearing from him shortly.

176	Call me if you have any questions.
177	Tom, Those items will be sent to you tommorrow.
178	Lisa, I feel so bad right now.
178	I never wanted anything but to be with you and love you the rest of my life.
178	I wish we knew how important it was to communicate with each other over the past years.
178	I think we are both guilty of not communicating.
178	It is easier to talk to some besides each other about certain things because of certain expectations or assumptions that have been built up over our portion of a lifetime together.
178	It hurts to now clearly understand this after things have happened.
178	I am scared of you moving in with Chris because I fear that we both may accept it as final.
178	I don't want it to be that and I want us to genuinely work on this relationship.
178	I want us to talk and do things together.
178	You are my one true love.
179	Melissa, I wasn't able to redline this version, but I added sections 10 and 11 and added futher language to Sections 3 and 6.
179	Hopefully you can redline it against your old version.
179	Let me know what you think about environmental indemnity language.
179	I think is is prudent from the view that Black Hills and has been using the Premises for some time and we are not sure what is out there.

221	The agreements look ok.

222	Joe, I would like to clarify which modifications are being made wrt each of the three landowners in the regarding heading.
222	I am not clear which easment we are deleting paragraph 9 on.
223	My motto.....
223	Drink heavy, live fast, leave clean underwear.
224	The letter looks fine.
224	I want to make sure that we don't record anything stating the ROW price.
224	If we need to put it in Exhibit B or something else which is not recorded, let's do so.
224	Thanks.
225	In a shocking move that will have the rest of the Big 12 playing recruiting "catch-up", OU has snatched a solid commitment from all-state wide out Delmer Shanks As a freshman, Shanks is expected to play in the "Opossum" set of OU's daunting new offense.
225	"The opossum spread is going to really fool people next year", Shanks explained in a phone interview from an Oklahoma Kwickie Mart.
225	"In the possum set, we take the left tackle and line him up out with 2 or 3 of our receivers. I lay up in the backfield, like a opossum, and then the center hikes the ball to the Tight End and then it's a hand off to either me or the quarterback.".
225	When asked about why he commited to OU in the middle of the season, a usually slow time of year for recruiting, Shanks had this to say.
225	"Well it was a no-brainer really.Skoalis going to be sponsoring OU athletics next year, so it just seemed like a natural fit. I really liked what they're gonna do with the uniforms, that sown-in dip ring they're putting on everyone's back pockets are gonna look real nice. They're also gonna do some neat stuff with the Switzer center too, gonna sell moon pies and stuff at the door."
225	Shanks did not take any official visits to other schools before his commitment, though he did say Texas A&M and OU had expressed interest in him all along.
225	"Yeah, they were plenty nice at A&M and Coach Slocum talked to momma a lot on the phone. He told her that this was gonna be the year they would pass more and that I would fit in real good with their high power pro-style attack".
225	It turns out that Delmer's mother did influence his decision some.
225	A laughing Shanks explains, "Yeah, we was out back pitching washers and momma come hollering outside...said Stoops promised her I would wear #8 at OU. We all been Dale Earnhardt Jr. fans for a long time, so we seen the importance of what they was saying. They don't honor you like that OU unless they done taken a real liking to you."
225	As the interview came to a close, Shanks had this to say, "Keep an eye on us, cause we're gonna be pretty darn good next year. We got 11 man plays in the book where the whole line is gonna go out on pass routes and we keep the water boy in to block for the quarterback. Boomer Sooner."
225	Only time will tell if schools like Texas, Nebraska and others can keep up with Stoops and his amazing program.

233	Marlene, We need to ask the counterparty what type of liens they have on their gas and we would want to limit it to those types in the contract.
233	We need as specific a description as possible.
233	If you want me to talk to someone at the counterparty I would be glad to do so.
233	Need a name and phone number.
233	Thanks.
234	Not sure what I am supposed to do with this.
235	Not sure if these are anything near what you are looking for but FYI.
236	D-Rock, Attached are a clean and redlined copy with my comments.
236	I have noted a couple of areas where I still have questions.
236	One that I didn't note in the agreement, is my concern that they could deny us a new Delivery Point if we can't agree on terms.
236	We need to discuss this one tommorrow.
236	I will shout out at ya tommorrow.
236	The Artist
237	Where were you guys?
237	I really need help.
237	In fact I need it so badly that I waited at Kenneally's until 2:00 am.
238	GT, Big game this week!
238	I heard ESPN Gameday is even going to be in Austin.
238	Sounds pretty cool.
238	OK if I crash at your place again?
238	I am planning on coming in early Saturday morning right now.
239	That sounds cool.
239	We talk more later.
240	So in other words, a typical night in the Gillaspie household, except for the sex.
241	Attached is the agreement with my markups.
241	Both clean and redlined.
242	Attached is a clean and redline version of the revised agreement.
242	Dan has not had a chance to review all the new language, but in the interest of time, I am sending this out for review.
243	I know he's not actually planning to crack the seal on that book and to sponge off us, so I have been feeding him bad information all week.
243	I can't wait until Kristi asks, "What could happen if you don't properly equalize?"
243	and he answers, "You could have painful flatulence for 6 months."
244	What time is the tailgate kicking off?
244	I am still driving in on Saturday morning.
244	Not sure if I have any 70s stuff, but I will take a look.
244	Need a tie dye.
245	I feel your pain brother.
245	I only about halfway through Section 1.
245	I haven't picked up the book in a while.

245	Is there a cliff notes version of this book??
246	Attached are clean and redline versions of my revisions to the Confidentiality Agreement.
246	Please Note: 1.

246	I will be in a due diligence this afternoon and most of tommorrow.

247	I will review and get back to you tommorrow.
247	Thanks.
248	Can you please pull the referenced contract and lets discuss.
249	Remember the line Clint gave when the bounty hunter wanted to take him back and he told Clint he we just trying to make a living.
249	Clint responded "Dying ain't much of a livin boy!"
249	Remember that.
249	That was awesome.
250	T minus 10 days?
251	Your welcome.
251	Maybe drinks and moonpies.
251	Sound good?
251	Maybe next week.
251	We'll talk after the legal boondoggle.
252	I will be in the Woodlands til probably around 7:30, but could meet you guys at that time.
252	Where and when?
252	The Mausoleum?
253	Please see attached.
254	FYI
255	Attached is the redline with the changes we discussed this morning.
256	Kay, Please review the attached and let me know if there are any issues.
256	Thanks.
257	Kay, Another CA Data Sheet check.
257	Thanks.
258	I'll be in town.
258	Let me know the details.
258	Eric may have trouble.
258	After the stunt he pulled Tuesday, the Warden's angry.
259	I enjoyed lunch today also.
259	It was nice to feel normal, even if only for a short time.
260	I am sending you some handwritten comments to this version.
260	I am going home the rest of the day.
260	If this is something that has to be sent out today, incorporate these comments in any new version.
260	Otherwise lets talk about it
261	GT, I won't be able to come in for the game this weekend.
261	I am taking a scuba diving class and I have open water dives on both Saturday and Sunday.
261	I am kinda pissed off at myself that I didn't realize this when I signed up for the class but now I am committed.
261	I will still sell the tickets to your brother and nephew if they want them though.
261	I can FEDEX the tickets to you by Friday or worst case, just have the ticket office leave passes for the seats at will call.
261	Let me know.
262	I will FEDEX the tickets.
262	Party hard for me.
262	G, You need to come to Houston when you get a chance and well have a good time.
263	GT, Ticket went Fedex today, and should be there tommorrow after 10 am.
263	If not please let me know.
263	I will get tix to Big 12 game and join the party bus.
263	Is Stacy going?
263	Sar!
264	Neta, I understand you currently have an agreement in place with Jomax Construction.
264	Enron Midstream Services, L.L.C.
264	wants to do an affiliate work order under the existing agreement.
264	Can you email the details on the agreement and forward a copy of the agreement.
264	I will use the form of Affiliate Work Order you forwarded prior.
264	Thanks for your help.
265	Ah yes!
265	A mini 2 year old cheese burger.
265	Why should that cause problems?
266	I again reviewed the storage contracts on which large value has been assessed.
266	The Cove Point LNG, Limited Partnership and Egan Hub Partners, L.P. are both FERC regulated entities and both agreements have negotiated rates.
266	The Cove Point deal has a negotiated reservation charge and the Egan Hub Partners has a negotiated storage reservation and injection charge.
266	Since we are buying the assets of Columbia and assigning the contracts to Enron and these deals are at less than max rates, they would be subject to reposting upon assignment and there would be no guarantee that Enron would receive these rates in a competetive bidding situation.
266	It is my understanding the discounts were taken into account for valuation purposes, however these discounts are at risk due to posting requirements.
266	The remainder of the storage contracts would require consents to assign.
266	Note: Any transport contracts with discounted rates would be subject to the same as above.
266	I am verifying the reposting requirements with Randy Rich of Bracewell & Patterson (FERC Counsel) and he is to get back with me early this afternoon.
266	I will let you know if anything changes.
267	Dan, Attached is a clean and redlined version of my changes.
267	As we discussed, the letter is now non-binding.

269	Dan, Attached is a clean and redlined version of the non-binding LOI.
269	Let me know if you have any questions.
270	GT, Was that an ass kicking or what?
270	The game look like a blast on TV.
270	I am still pissed I missed it.
270	Did you get the tickets okay?
270	Hope so.
270	How was the Tailgate?
270	Any sweet sweet babies?
271	More Coz 2000 T-shirt slogans.

272	How did Lisa take the Red Raider butt whipping?
272	Give her my condolences.
273	Jim, Attached is a clean and redline version of your letter with my comments.
273	The deal maker on this one is probably the appropriate person to sign this one.
273	Is it Jim Ducote?
273	Is Greg Brazaitis or Steve Schneider aware of this project?
274	Pat, Could you print all these out for me.
274	I need two copies.
274	Thanks.

278	GT, I was surfing on the aggie BBS during lunch and stumbled across a post with this picture on it.
278	This is hilarious.
278	Go to this site and take a look.
279	A little Mihm action.
280	Mark, Attached are redlines of the revisions to the O&M and CSA Docs.
281	Same stuff going on here.
281	Lisa and I are still settling things.
281	Looks like I am going to keep the house.
281	So you need to come into town and well have a good time.
281	My address is: 1403 Banks Houston, Texas 77006 I am hooked up with tickets to the Big 12 game.
281	Are you guys still planning on a bus to SA?
282	In the literate world (outside of Iowa) this is a "poll", not "pole".
283	I was thinking about coming into Austin Friday night and driving up with you guys on Saturday and staying in Austin again Saturday night.
283	I am going to have a friend with me (male unfortunately) since I have two tickets.
283	Let me know if that fits in with your plans.
284	Three problems with this Draft.
284	1.
284	In Paragraph 1.1, they removed my requirement of installing a system to meet "all of Enron's electrical power requirements for the Driver".
284	My concern here is that they put in equipment that is not adequate to handle our load requirements.
284	At a minimum we should state a specific load requirement for this station.
284	E.g.
284	10,000 HP.
284	2.
284	In Paragraph 1.1, they inserted a requirement that Plain's approve any in-service date for the driver and that the Telecommunication Equipment would be in-service by such date.
284	My draft had a date established by Enron solely and Plains would have to meet such date.
284	I think we need control of our in-service date without Plains prior approval.
284	We will be reasonable in establishing such date.
284	3.
284	Plains disclaims all warranties with respect to the Telecommunication Equipment.
284	This was not in the first draft.
284	We need some assurance that this equipment will do the job we need it to.
284	I would be happy to discuss these directly with Plains' attorneys at their convenience.
285	Arnold, Do you have a name and number of the Plains attorneys (or someone who has their number) so I can discuss the attached issues with them concering the Comm Agreement.
286	Attached is the final version of the mechanical maintenance agreement.
287	Attached is Greg's email with my response in bold inserted.
287	Based on my review notes.
287	Let me know if you need anything else.
287	Enron North America Corp.
288	GT, Do you have a ticket for the game set up.
288	The guy going to the game with me, is not 100% committed.
288	If you don't need it, he will use it.
288	I will be coming to Austin by myself though and he would meet me at the game.
288	Are you driving up to SA with anyone?
289	Attached is a short summary of our review of the Transport and Storage (Off System) for KN Marketing.
290	Attached is the due diligence review summary prepared by the legal asset groups for the West Texas Assets at the KN Data Room.

301	Attached are drafts of the MidCon Interconnect Agreement for Deer Park and Greens Bayou.
301	The agreements are written with the following key points.
301	1.
301	HPL will install both meter facility to mutally agreeable specifications.
301	2.
301	HPL will own and operate the Greens Bayou Point.
301	3.
301	MidCon will own and operate the Deer Park Point.
301	4.
301	All costs to install both interconnects will be shared 50/50 by the Parties under a true up mechanism based on actual costs.
301	5.
301	Pressure committments by both Parties for 5 years, with failure to meet such committments resulting in reimbursement by the failing Party of all costs borne by the non-failing Party for that interconnect only at which the pressure committment is not met.
301	6.
301	Each Party has a right to use at all times 50% of the then available capacity at each interconnect, unless a Party fails to meet its pressure Please review.
302	Article 4 and 6 are the most relevant
303	Dan, The only other thing I can think of is taking a security interest in the assets we are financing, if we are concerned about these guys being a credit risk.
303	We did this with the MTG deal.
303	I have a form of mortgage agreement which works with this type of deal.
303	I would guess credit needs to make that call.
303	Let me know if you want the form.
303	Enron North America Corp.
304	Attached is the form of amendment to the Dow Brining and Cavern Lease Agreement.

307	Merry Christmas.
308	Dan, Attached is the form.
308	It references the agreement we are lending the money under (and Events of Default thereunder) and also needs to have exhibits prepared.
308	We probably also should check to see if there are any existing Security Interest in these assets.
308	The ones we know that we are subordinate to should be noted in the mortgage.
308	Shonnie has a contact in Wyoming she has used before to search the county records for any existing security interest.
309	Dan, Please review.
309	I will be in tommorrow morning and we can discuss and changes needed.
310	You have probably done this already, but remove any reference to SCADA in the Alstom agreement.

323	Thanks.
324	Brad, Please reviewed the attached before we send to MidCon for their review.
324	Pay particular attention to the pressure committment sections.
324	Thanks.
325	Steve, Let's take out the reference to approaching the FERC in this letter.
325	I would emphasize that they have had more than enough time for a response and while we would like to think they are cooperating, the lack of response little reason to believe otherwise.
325	Suggest that any further delay would require us to explore all our options for access into CMS.
325	At this point I would feel more comfortable with suggesting we would need to go to FERC via a phone conversation with CMS.
325	Let me know if you want to discuss this further.
325	Enron North America Corp.

331	GT, That sounds great on the house.
331	What are you remodeling?
331	The carpet and kitchen?
331	I have been out chasing some myself.
331	It is amazing how may screwed women there are out there.
331	Some good looking ones though.
331	I am out of town the next couple of weekends, but some time after that would be good.
331	Early February around the 12th or any time thereafter.

340	Lets skin that smoke wagon!
341	I noticed that there was one bio missing.
341	So here goes, Eric Gillaspie: 28 Junior Attorney extradonaire for Enron North America, wannabe Rock-n-Roll star.
341	Prone to performing at least one incredibly embarassing act every time he goes out drinking including, but not limited to, falling down in bars, kicking people on the dance floor with his incredibly gay dance steps, and lapsing into siezures resulting in the tossing of a full Gin&Tonic on senior attorneys.
341	Often mistaken for the cute little guy in the movie "Jerry Maguire" (Dogs and Bees can smell fear) not only because of his looks, but also his level of speech and depth of conversation.
341	Thinks the Rolling Stones stole all of their best material from BuckCherry and finally, "Our dive captain".
342	Jim, Attached are the interconnect agreements for the MidCon Flagstaff (formerly Greens Bayou) and Deer Park points.

344	However, I had no luck at gambling.
344	The cards just weren't falling for me in Black Jack.
344	Yes, a friend of mine from Enron is moving back to Houston from Portland, so this is working out great.
344	Very close to getting the divorce finalized.
344	Should be done in a week or two.
344	Talk to you later and hope all finds you well.
345	Pat, I will be out the 4, 7, and 8th of Feb.
346	Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Kern River CA
347	Has-Been College Football Dynasties.
347	Hmmm, lets see.
347	Who else would fit into that category?
348	Dan, Attached are the draft Kennedy Amendments.
348	Please review and forward to Kennedy if acceptable.
349	Please disregard the prior versions.
350	New email is Gerald.Nemec@enron.com
351	Thanks for the greeting card.
351	I am not sure if the guy mooning me meant something, but I will take it in a humorous manner.
351	Remember, Be strong and confident.
351	Gerald (G$)
352	Attached is a draft for your review.
352	Please review and lets discuss any comments.
352	After re-reading the purchase and gathering agreement, I think the amendments should work in their present form.
352	The 2,500 Western gas needs to be noted as an exception on Exhibits A of both Agreements.
352	Exception should read "Up to the first 2,500 mmbtu/day of production from the Caballo Area shall be delivered to Western.... with ENA (or EMS as applicable for the agreement) receiving all volumes in excess of such 2,500 mmbtu/day. Any decline in the Caballo Area production shall apply ratably between Western's 2,500 mmbtu/day and ENA's (or EMS as applicable for the agreement) production levels."
352	I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind.
353	Attached are the latest revisions.
353	The Compression Admin.
353	Agreement includes a clean and redlined version.
353	Please review.
354	Thanks for the note.
354	Hope you and Will have a wonderful Valentines Day.
355	Dan, Attached is the revised gathering amendment for your review.
356	Susan, Attached is a draft of the side letter for regulatory out we discussed last week along with the operational control agreement.
356	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
357	Nice job on the photos.
357	Really makes me realize how drunk I was at certain times.
357	The good thing is that the "Dude" I met in Joe's and I are now pen pals and he will be coming to Houston to visit very soon.
357	Maybe he was my long lost brother.
357	I am making a phone call to my Mom right now too see if she has anything she wants to explain to me.
358	Steve, Do you have an executed copy of the Trunkline Confidentiality Agreement for the LNG terminal in Lake Charles?
358	Need to get one for our files.
358	Thanks.
359	That's not funny!
360	It is all about drinking with you isn't it?
360	You need to get a grip.
360	I will have to pass on the Rudz Suds as I will be dining at one of Houston's finer eateries with captains of industry tonight.
360	However, Eric and I were kicking around a possible road trip to the beautiful island of Galveston this weekend.
360	Saturday or Sunday?
360	Think that nice friend of yours, Willis, might be interested?
360	Please respond appropriately with your level of interest!
360	Just to anticipate the tone of your response, I will go ahead and call you a "Smart Ass" right now.
361	It is showing up on my computer and seems to be working.
362	RFP, I had a good time also.
362	The bands were interesting though.
362	I bet that dude in the helmet sweated his ass off during the performance.
362	The date was actually her call.
362	We are meeting some of her friends out for dinner and drinks and then some sweet sweet love.
362	Seriously, this girl is cool and a lot of fun.
362	Should be a good time.
362	Of course I am assuming that the date is still on.
362	In my clear thinking state last night when I left Rudz (a la 1 pm) I called her and woke her up.
362	I really have no idea what I said to her.
362	She may not be speaking to me anymore.
362	What was with Willis last night?
362	No show!
362	Let's circle the wagons this afternoon to discuss Galveston.
363	I'm sorry.
363	Eric and I aren't speaking at the moment due to creative differences.
363	I want only the orange M&M's removed from our dressing room and he wants only the brown ones removed.
364	Attached is Exhibit C to the Gallup O&M Agreement.
364	The original document left this Exhibit to follow later.
364	We also still owe you Exhibit B (Description of Compressor Motor Facilities) to the O&M Agreement and Exhibit B to the CSA (Proposed form of No. 21 Schedule).
364	These will follow shortly.
365	Attached for your review is the letter agreement which locks in the Gas Conversion Agreement pricing.
366	Sounds like a good trip if there are spaces available.
366	I think our dive captain is checking availability.
366	Of course our dive captain is also hesitant about being swallowed whole by a Whale Shark.
366	I told him that with a house to remodel that would probably be a blessing.
366	Let us know what your schedule is.
366	See if we can't hook up Thursday or Friday for lunch.
366	I open and I am sure Nacious E would be too.
367	True.
367	Especially after I cut E's fat plump rump roast with my dive knife to chum the waters a little.
367	Let's shoot for Friday for lunch.
367	Maybe I go back to work after that or maybe I don't.
367	No other three Czech brothers can cruise so successfully in tight slacks!
367	Things are going well with little Cynthia.
367	She is really fun and easy to talk to.
367	I am not sure what my intentions are right now but we enjoy each others company.
368	Stephanie, Could you please add me to the distribution list for these types of meetings.
368	Thanks.
369	Tracy, Thanks for the pictures.
369	Cute kid.
369	Frank does look like you.
369	I need to come by and see Frank in person.
369	Sorry that I have been out of the loop for some time but sometimes life is weird.
369	I am sure Tom told you that Lisa and I are getting divorced.
369	It is still hard for me to comprehend this, but all I can do is continue to move forward with my life.
369	Anyway, hope to see you guys soon sometime and keep sending pictures.
369	Gerald
370	Yes I am!
370	Let me know what time you are available and where you are this week and I will pick an appropriate location.
370	G$ and Nacious E are available.
370	You need a nickname too.
370	Let's ponder this one and submit ideas.
371	Let's plan on meeting at the Original Tila's (not Teala's) on Kirby right where the road curves before it heads down to Allen Parkway.
371	Around 11:45 am?
371	As far as nicknames go: Punchy Steel Nipple Cherry Vodka The Ambassador Sling (you will sing all our Police cover tunes)
372	Ruppert, If you there, call me at work immediately.
372	713-853-3512.
373	Mark, Attached is a draft of the power agreement with my changes redlined in. I still have a few more, but wanted to get the majority of these to you asap.
373	Targeting Monday to forward to CDEC.
374	Everything is going well.
374	Sorry I haven't gotten back to you, but I have been really busy at work and with other things.
374	I will give a call when I get a chance.
375	Attached is a clean and redline version with my changes.
375	I made a few further refinements to the agreement.
375	I think it would be a good idea to walk CDEC through these changes as a lot of these are form not substance.
376	Mark, Please disregard the prior versions and review this one.
376	This includes Section 1.4 which requires CDEC to provide us access with the load projection systems that are in place.
377	FYI
378	Janet, Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Confidentiality Agreement (Trunkline) with the revisions we discussed.
378	Please review.
378	Bobby Gaspard with Trunkline, asked that I forward the revised draft via email and after their review an executable.
378	Please forward to Bobby for his review at bjgaspard@cmsenergy.com if you are okay with this draft.
379	Looks like we got another one.
379	Sounds like we duplicate the agreement we create for Ginger and use for this interconnect.
379	Let's discuss when we get a chance.
380	Well it looks like Eric is now officially burden with an oppressive mortgage.
380	Won't be long before he is out mowing the lawn in Bermuda short and sandals with black socks.
380	Eventually all the good ones go down.
380	What up with you, JT?
381	Jeff, Attached is the form with some modifications.
381	Please see that this is the form utilized for all releases in the future.
381	Please call me if you have any questions.
381	(713) 853-3512
382	Attached is a clean and redlined version the agreement with our revisions.
383	Ken, This is the complete document.
383	The schedule are attached to it.
384	Stephanie, I forwarded a hard copy of the operational control letter yesterday.
384	Let me know if you don't have it.
384	Attached is the price letter.
384	There is no formal contract in place between TW and EE&CC for the construction.
384	Both TW and ECS as I understand, have signed AFE's with EE&CC for the projects.
384	We will most likely have to address this risk in the Contribution Agreement.
384	I will talk with Mark and Mark about this.
384	PPA- we are expecting comments back from CDEC late today.
384	Schedule is now to review their comments and meet with them Tuesday (via phone or in person) to finalize.
384	We can likely get Patti a copy after Tuesday.
384	Contribution Agreement - Pending resolution of the construction risk issues, we can have a draft for Patti early next week.
385	TW has the final draft, since they prepared the document.
385	I have asked for it via email.
385	As soon as I receive I will forward.
385	Thanks.
385	Enron Global Finance
386	Here it is.
387	See attached and let me know if you have any questions.
388	I have directed my boy Eric to do some research and he came up with the following.
388	Attendance at one or both shows is a possibility.
388	Interested?
389	Bob, Please review the attached scope of work from Jeff Gilliam.
389	He wants to prepare a Work Offer under the Moutain West MSA with the attached.
389	Please review and lets discuss if you have questions.
390	Pat, Please use the distribution on the attached email for the meeting notice.
390	In the meeting notice please remind attendees to bring the action items we discussed at the previous meeting summary forwarded earlier.
391	GT, What's up?
391	Got that house in order yet?
391	Keeps you busy doesn't it.
391	Hope everything is going well.
391	I and the redfaced Eric are thinking about a road trip to Austin on the weekend of March 18th.
391	A band we really want to check out (Tenacious D) is playing at La Zona Rosa on Sat.
391	the 18th.
391	Are you going to be around that weekend?
391	We have confirmation via some web site that Tenacious D will be there, but have tried calling La Zona Rosa about tix with no success.
391	Do you know anything about this place?
391	Are the concerts usually walk up tix sales?
391	Let me know what your schedule looks like.
391	Oh yeah, Eric's wife Jennifer will probably accompany him to Austin.
391	Eric couldn't get a hall pass for the weekend.
392	Attached is a clean and redlined version of the agreement with my changes after discussion with Dick Shirley and Fred Lackey this morning.
392	I will also fax a copy to them.
393	Sure.
393	Let me know when and where.
394	That sounds fine.
394	I haven't recieved any further mail for you from Shell.
394	I think you said there should be more coming.
395	Attached is the EnergyShare 2000 Agreement with my revisions included.
395	Included is both a clean and redlined version.
395	I did not review in detail the payment calculation methodology.
395	I will leave this to Mark Courtney and John Scarborough for their review.
395	Please feel free to call me at (713) 853-3512 if you have any questions or wish to discuss my revisions.
396	Kay, Please review the attached.
396	Thanks for your help.
397	Attached is the letter agreement which extended the EE&CC confidentiality agreement to our deal.
397	Please review and if it looks OK, print out on ENA letterhead two copies for execution.
397	I will need an original when it is executed.
398	GT, Sounds like things are going well.
398	Can't wait to check out the house and Heather.
398	As for myself, I have been hanging out with Cynthia.
398	Met her through a friend.
398	I guess we are dating.
398	Not to anxious to stay with one girl at this point.
398	I'll let you know more early next week about the road trip.
398	Take care.
398	You wouldn't happen to know someone who could get us cheap South by Southwest passes.
398	We think we will need those passes to see Tenacious D.
399	Here are their comments.
399	I will review over the weekend and lets plan on discussing Monday morning.
400	Attached is the revised scope of work for use with the Mt.
400	West Work Offer.
401	Hello!
401	Hope your day is going well.
401	As for me, it has been pretty busy.
401	Dropped my tux off at lunch and it only took about 2 seconds.
401	I know you were looking forward to going with me to drop that off, but you missed out.
401	I had a great time this weekend.
401	Thanks again for accompanying me to the UH affair extraordinair.
401	Nice dress!!
401	Have a great rest of the day and I will talk to you later.
402	Attached is the form of CA.
402	Set up as a bilateral for asset deals primarily.
402	Easily adjusted to suit your needs though.
403	If Men TRULY Ran The World...
403	1.
403	Breaking up would be a lot easier.
403	A smack to the ass and a "Nice hustle, you'll get'em next time" would pretty much do it.
403	2.
403	Birth control would come in ale or lager.
403	3.
403	Valentine's Day would be moved to February 29th so it would only occur in leap years.
403	4.
403	On Groundhog Day, if you saw your shadow, you'd get the day off to go drinking.
403	Mother's Day too.
403	5.
403	St. Patrick's Day, however, would remain exactly the same.
403	But it would be celebrated every month.
403	6.
403	Garbage would take itself out.
403	7.
403	Regis and Kathie Lee would be chained to a cement mixer and pushed off the Golden Gate Bridge for the most lucrative pay-per-view event in world history.
403	8.
403	The only show opposite "Monday Night Football" would be "Monday Night Football from a Different Camera Angle."
403	9.
403	Instead of "beer-belly," you'd get "beer-biceps."
403	10.
403	Tanks would be far easier to rent.
403	12.
403	When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-aleck answer you responded with would actually reduce your fine.
403	As in: Cop: "You know how fast you were going?"
403	You: "All I know is, I was spilling my beer all over the place."
403	Cop: "Nice one, That's $10.00 off".
403	13.
403	People would never talk about how fresh they felt.
403	14.
403	Daisy Duke shorts would never go out of style again.
403	15.
403	Every man would get four, real Get Out of Jail Free cards per year.
403	16.
403	Telephones would cut off after 30 seconds of conversation.
403	17.
403	It would perfectly legal to steal a sports car, as long as you returned it the following day with a full tank of gas.
403	18.
403	Instead of a fancy, expensive engagement ring, you could present your wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said "You're #1!".
403	19.
403	When your girlfriend really needed to talk to you during the game, she'd appear in a little box in the corner of the screen during a time-out.
403	20.
403	Nodding and looking at your watch would be deemed as an acceptable response to "I love you."
403	21.
403	The funniest guy in the office would get to be CEO.
403	22.
403	"Sorry I'm late, but I got wasted last night," would be an acceptable excuse for tardiness.
403	23.
403	At the end of the workday a whistle would blow and you would jump out of your window and slide down the tail of a brontosaurus and right into your car like Fred Flintstone.
403	24.
403	Lifeguards could remove citizens from beaches for violating the "public ugliness" ordinance.
403	25.
403	Hallmark would make "Sorry, what was your name again?"
403	cards.
404	Attached is the final version of the Bammel Compression Turnkey Construction Agreement used in Project Looper.
404	This agreement will require some modification for use in Project Coca-Cola, but is a good starting point.
404	In the interest of efficiency I am circulating this for your review and comments.
404	We can then discuss how this needs to be tailored for the CO2 project.
404	Please note the following with respect to this agreement: 1.
404	A detailed engineering scope of work will be required for the treaters.
404	2.
404	Given the financing objectives for this project, this agreement should be as lump sum price as possible with liquidated damages for in-service date risk.
404	3.
404	A performance criteria guarantee section will need to be added which references specific plant peformance criteria in the scope of work.
404	FYI, I will be in Albuquerque tommorrow for a Compression Services project.
404	After your review let's discuss.
405	Mark, The letter with my comments incorporated.
406	David, Attached is a short term sheet agreement that I propose we put into place for the Gallup electric driver which EECC is installing for Enron Compression Services Company.
406	As I understand it now, we have only an AFE with signature for this deal in place.
406	As I indicated on my voice mail, I need something more substantial in place for assignment, since we are selling a portion of this project off to investors.
406	Please review and lets discuss.
406	Timing unfortunately is not long as usual.
406	I would like to meet as soons as your schedule allows.
406	Thanks.
407	Yeah, LSU almost lost though.
407	Should be interesting.
407	I think the SEC in general is a little overrated after the Kentucky and LSU games
408	Attached is the assignment and contribution agreement for your review.
408	I would like to get your feedback prior to wide circulation.
408	Note: We are still working with EE&CC to put a basic construction agreement in place for assignment to the LLC.
408	ECS retains payment obligation under the construction agreement even after assignment into the LLC.
408	Thanks for your help.
409	FYI, The issue we discussed this morning.
410	David, Attached is the agreement with the revisions we discussed.
410	Please review.
410	I tried to redline againt the previous version, but any section that I modified displayed as an entire rewrite of the section.
410	Maybe you will have better luck redlining.
410	Please call with any questions.
410	X 33512.
411	Got the redline to work.
411	Attached is the redlined version of the construction agreement.
412	I reviewed these changes and they look fine.
412	Please prepare the executables.
412	Thanks.
413	Attached for your review in the Gallup Transaction are the following documents: 1.
413	Assignment and Contribution Agreement - Assignment operational documents and rights in assets from ECS into the LLC 2.
413	Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Agreement - Defines relationship between ECS and Enron Engineering and Construction Company for installation of the motor driver at Gallup.
413	This document will be assigned into the LLC except for that portion which relates to the electric power transmission line.
413	The utility will take ownership of the transmission line per the power purchase agreement.
413	Also forwarded via hard copy yesterday, was the executed Power Purchase Agreement.
413	Please let me know if you have not received this yet.
413	I will shortly email the form of gas purchase agreement between the LLC and ECS.
413	This will merely be a new Confirm (Transaction Agreement "C") which will operate under the existing Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Agreement between ECS and the LLC which was created for Kachina.
414	Henry, I will resend a copy of the PPA.
415	Hi Katie, Looks like you got the address right.
415	I too enjoyed talking with you last night.
415	I know you were disappointed to be distracted from your research project for a while.
415	Its been a busy week so far.
415	The end of the yearly quarter always is.
415	Last minute deals have to be closed to book the income.
415	At this time of year the commercial dealmakers get that wild eyed looked which says "I have got to get this project done or I am out of here".
415	March 31 can't arrive soon enough.
415	Got any big plans for the weekend?
415	Hanging out at the Dixie Chicken or is that only where rookies hang out?
415	Take care and I'll talk to you later.
415	Gerald
416	How are things going?
416	Haven't talked to you in a while.
416	As for me, I am fine.
416	Work is pretty busy right now.
416	We are at the end of the quarter and have to get certain deals closed before March 31, so it can get hectic.
416	My roommate will be leaving shortly.
416	He got a job opportunity with his family in North Carolina, so he will be moving.
416	Didn't last very long, but I knew that was a possibility when he moved in. Are you guys getting into the wedding planning mode now with Sharon.
416	It should really be a beautiful wedding up in Estes Park.
416	Very nice mountain scenery.
416	Take care and I will talk with you later.
416	Gerald.
417	Gentlemen, Yes that means you, Eric.
417	Please review the attached and give me any comments before I distribute to the group.
418	Amy, I revised a few things in the agreement.
418	Should be ready to go.
419	Heather, I talked further with Transwestern Counsel today concerning the issues and have the following points; 1.
419	FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS in the filings for the certification of the Kachina units.
419	FERC simply didn't ask any further questions in that proceeding.
419	The Operation & Maintenance Agreements in place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same tasks as the Operational Control Agreement in Gallup.
419	TW feels the O&M agreements would be adequate to address any concerns about TW's regulatory responsibility over the compressor facilities.
419	The Operational Control agreement was put into place in the Gallup Transaction because it was thought to be easier to give FERC exactly what is was looking for rather than provide them with the Gallup O&M Agreement which might unecessarily complicate the certification process at that time.
419	2.
419	There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of penalty or discontinue the Compression Service due to TW's operation of Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.
419	No regs or law address this situation.
419	Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in place to accomplish control for TW.
419	3.
419	I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that the petition for rehearing does not effect the status of the certificate.
419	Construction is moving ahead and the targeted start date is May 1.
419	I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as soon as I recieve it.
419	Let me know if you have any further questions (713)
420	Attached is the letter under which TW approved the Power Purchase Agreement.
420	I will forward an executed copy as well.
421	Please review the attached.
421	I am still waiting on an answer from Davis concerning Section 3.2.
421	It may need to be tweaked a little more.
422	Hi Katie, I am feeling good about status of the deals!
422	Looks like we should close next Wednesday.
422	So as it stands now, I don't think I will have to work this weekend.
422	Of course now that I just said that, it almost positive that something will come up.
422	Hmmm, Actually work might not be such a bad thing as my alternative is helping my roommate pack his stuff up for his move to North Carolina.
422	Have a great weekend!
422	Talk to you soon.
422	Gerald
423	In the spirit of your previous email, check this one out.
424	Susan, Attached is the amendment we discussed.
424	We would like to execute this today.
424	Mark indicated that Steve would sign today if everything looks OK.
424	Thanks for your help, Susan.
425	John, Good to hear from you.
425	Things are going fine.
425	There aren't really any parking garages close to the ballpark and getting near the ballpark on an open lot will be damn near impossible.
425	I believe metro will be running a shuttle from open lots in downtown which are probably about 10 blocks away from the park.
425	There are several of these lots around the Enron building and Smith and Lousiana St. Might be worth checking the either the Metro web site or the Enron Field web site to get exact details on the Shuttle routes.
425	I believe the shuttle will drop off directly in front of the park.
425	I received the Nemec Family Reunion flyer recently.
425	Looks like your whole family got drafted into service this year.
425	I guess thats a danger of showing up at those things.
425	Take care and we'll talk to you later.
426	Thanks, That does the trick.
427	Attached for review is the Confirmation (under existing Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Agreement between ECS and ECC) for the gas received by ECC from TW pursuant to the Gas Conversion Agreement.
428	Attached is the form of Amendment to the Gas Conversion Agreement that was executed by TW on Friday.
428	The Amendment does the following: 1.
428	Shifts gas flow delivery to commence upon the Start Date instead of the 2 month lag.
428	2.
428	Deems the Start Date for all operational documents with TW to be May 1, 2000 regardless of when physical start up occurs.
428	Please contact me at (713) 853-3512 with any questions.
429	Attached are Exhibits A to both the Operation and Maintenance Agreement and the Contribution and Assignment Agreement - Description of the Assets The descriptions of the Assets are duplicate on both Exhibits.

430	Please review.
431	Ruppert, Unfortunately it doesn't look like I am going to be able to make it due to work.

437	Its been a hectic week so far.
437	This deal is scheduled to close Thursday morning and then a I catch a flight to Denver Thursday afternoon.
437	I have been putting the guys off in our Denver office for some time so I will be busy with them all day Friday and then a flight back to Houston on Saturday.
437	Denver is a cool town, so it should be fun on Friday night.

439	Eric, Please take a stab at drafting the interconnect agreement.
439	This is Mary Jo's deal.
440	Steve, Those were CPS's suggested changes, not mine.
440	I agree.
440	I don't know what they want for Section 6 and Jim has agreed to get with CPS to get further definition.
440	I also recommend pulling the language inserted in Section 3 as Jim indicated we have already submitted all the estimates.
440	The Bexar county venue is unacceptable and will be stricken.
440	David Marshall is reviewing the insurance section and should have an answer today.
441	Hi Katie, So far so good.
441	Busy but moving forward.
441	It will be interesting to see if I catch my flight or if I have to delay it some.
441	Denver should be nice.
441	I was watching the weather channel and it appears that it will be pretty cold up there.
441	I saw something about lows in the 10-20s.
441	Yikes!
441	You're right though.
441	I enjoy traveling every once in a while for a change of pace.
441	The guys I work with up there are fun, so that makes the work go alot easier.
441	Take care and talk to you later.
441	Gerald
442	Sometimes the media gets it right.
443	Hi Katie, Yes I am back in town.
443	Sorry I wasn't able to return your email yesterday.
443	It has just been crazy around here and I am leaving for San Antonio tommorrow and will be out the rest of the week for the Enron Legal Conference.
443	It is going to be at La Cantera on the northwest side of SA.
443	The place sounds pretty relaxing, so it should be fun.
443	Back in Houston Friday late.
443	Yea Denver was nice.
443	Slight delay in the flight, but not due to weather.
443	Just the usual airline misadventures.
443	It was snowing pretty hard when I arrived.
443	Kinda nice to be around some actual cold weather for a change.
443	Worked all day Friday and stayed with some friends Sat.
443	night.
443	Wish I had time to go up to the mountains for skiing.
443	So your not big on skiing huh?
443	The first time I went I hated it, but as you get better it really becomes a lot of fun.
443	Last time I went (last March) I tried snowboarding.
443	It was a lot of work to learn a new snow sport.
443	It was cool after I got the hang of it, except for dislocating my shoulder.
443	Ouch!
443	Sounds like ya'll had a good time at Northgate.
443	I hate it when friends take you out and get you drunk.
443	That seems to happen to me occasionally.
443	OK more than occasionally.
443	This time change does make for a rough week.
443	I didn't wake up until 8:00 am for work on Monday.
443	Just a little later for work than usual.
443	Coming into Houston anytime soon?
443	If you get a chance, I'd really like to take you to dinner sometime.
443	Take care.
443	Bye!
443	Gerald
444	I will revise the documents to reflect Flagstaff and the items we discussed at the meeting previously.
444	Kevin's email indicates he wants to remove the language concerning a party obligations to refund the costs of the interconnect paid for by that party, if the other party is unable to maintain their pressure obligations.
444	Does this need to stay or be removed?
444	If this needs to stay, should someone tell Kevin that it will remain in the agreement ?

454	Trying to clean up and prepare a binder of all documents.
454	Thanks.
455	John, Attached are the case historys for the two cases.
455	Note: Followed - means the court followed the holding in the case cited Dissenting Opinion - means the dissenting justices referenced the case only (not really relevant) Distinguished - court didn't follow the holding of the case or simply found that the facts of the two cases were different.
455	Hope this helps.
456	I put in a call this morning to discuss.
456	Left a voicemail.
456	I will let you know what develops.
456	Thanks.
457	Attached is the form of confidentiality agreement for the Colonial project.
457	Per Mark Knippa's request I am forwarding for your review.
458	Hi Katie, That email was pretty true.
458	School can be extremely stressful in short periods (around finals) but overall compared to work it was really a pretty easy lifestyle.
458	How are thing's going for you with school?
458	Sounded like this month was going to be a busy one.
458	The good thing about school is that there is a definite ending point with a break between.
458	It has calmed down some around here.
458	Focusing on things that I had dropped during the end of quarter stretch.
458	I bought a new guitar yesterday.
458	My friend Eric and I had our eye on this black Fernandes model for some time and yesterday we decided to go for it.
458	I am still in the learning stages of playing but it won't be too long before fame and stardom are at my disposal.
458	Well maybe a little longer than that.
458	Playing is really fun and a good stress reliever though.
458	Hope everthing is going well for you.
458	Take care, Gerald
459	Kay, Please review the attached.
460	What's going on Tree?
460	Bruce forwarded me your email address, probably against your wishes.
460	Just thought I'd drop a line and see if your up for beers sometime this weekend.
460	I know its tough to fit anytime in between those dates with the lovely fake breasted super models, but let's try and hook up sometime.
461	Per Jaime Ginsberg's request I am forward our form of Confidentiality Agreement for your review.
462	Per Jaime Ginsberg's request, I am forwarding our form of Confidentiality Agreement for your review.
463	Clement, Attached is a form of guaranty by Enron Corp. for ECS Compression Services Company, LLC.
463	(ECC).
463	ECC is owned approximately 9% by Enron Compression Services Company (a 100% owned ENA subsidiary).
463	The form has been reviewed by Continental Divide Electric Cooperative, Inc. (the Counterparty) and they are OK with it.
463	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
463	If everything looks good, please obtain execution.
463	Thanks for your help.
464	Mike.
464	Generally the language is fine, but I tweaked to make sure it is clearer.
464	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
465	FYI.
465	Here is the email from La Joie du Vin concerning other wine appreciation groups.
466	Kay, Could you please send me a copy of the CA.
466	Thanks.
467	The construction agreement with the date information we discussed.
468	Sounds like you are running and gunning.
468	I know how those times feel.
468	Seems like it is never going to end.
468	You have been through it enough times to know that it always does.
468	I don't think there is any feeling like turning in that last paper or walking out of that last final at the end of a semester.
468	Feels like a huge weight is lifted off your shoulders.
468	After that comes lifting the huge mug filled with beer.
468	Hang in there.
468	Gerald
469	I lost the information concerning fly fishing you left on my voice mail.
469	Could you be so kind as to resend via email.
469	I am thinking of just taking a poll to see what everyone's interest are.
469	I personally am thinking Mountain Biking sounds like great fun and a super way to endanger my life.
469	Drop me a note when you get a chance.
469	Also what is the schedule for the get together on Sat.
470	Bruce, Attached is an article I found in the Houston Chronicle business section yesterday.
470	Has a negative outlook, but mostly related to product supply B2Bs.
470	You probably are familiar with most of the B2Bs they mention.
470	Thought might be useful to you.
470	Good talking to you yesterday.
470	The check better arrive this week or I start breaking your stuff one piece at a time.
471	Attached is the master form with the quality language revised.
471	Please use this form from this point forward.
472	Hi Wayne, Thanks for the email.
472	Things are going fine here in Houston.
472	Unfortunately this weekend is going to be a bad one for me.
472	I have to work Friday and have plans already for Saturday.
472	Some other time would probably work better.
472	Let me know what your schedule looks like and we can work something out.
472	Hope things are going well for you in Austin.
472	Drop me a line when you get a chance.
472	Gerald
473	Please review the attached and lets discuss.
474	Katie, Glad I cheered you up.
474	Believe me, I can relate.
474	I could tell you horror stories about when I was studying for the bar exam.
474	I'll save those for some other time.
474	Hope all is going well and moving forward.
474	What always kept me going was the idea that in a few days or a week it would all be over and I wanted to be able to look back and feel that I had given the best effort I could.
474	That's all you can do.
474	It is typically more than enough to do very well in grades.
474	I will quit preaching now and let you get back to work.
474	No big plans for the Easter Weekend.
474	Will be here in Houston.
474	I actually have to work on Friday, but am thinking about taking a vacation day.
474	Sounds like you will probably be busy with school and family over your weekend in Katy, but give me a call if you feel like it.
474	Maybe we can do something fun.
474	"This too shall come to pass" - Famous quote by some dead guy.
474	Gerald
475	I recieved the interconnect agreements (executed by Southern Union) this morning.
475	Attached is the form of interconnect agreement that was executed by Southern Union.
475	I will forward to Steve Schneider for execution on behalf of HPL.
475	Please let me know if you have any questions.
476	Jim, Forgot to mention in the note, that we will need the drawing for Exhibit A to be attached to the agreement.
476	Thanks.
477	Oops.
477	I just found the drawing you had already sent me.
477	Sorry.
478	Ron, Couple of comments.
478	1.
478	Enitity Name - You noted that Trailblazer is a limited partnership.
478	The name should designate limited partnership in some form (e.g. Trailblazer Pipeline Company, L.P.) Also for an LP the General Partner will need to sign to make it binding.
478	The signature block should read as follows: Trailblazer Pipeline Company, L.P. by its General Partner, _________________________ 2.
478	The limitation on consequential damages limits any remedy under this agreement.
478	The only types of damages in a situation like this is really consequential.
478	I think it would benefit both parties to leave this limitation out of the agreement.
478	If you would like to discuss these issues, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.
478	Thank You.
479	For your files.
479	I sent the executables to Lauri Allen.
480	Becky, Not sure if anyone in Denver is on the distribution list.
480	If not Scott Sitter in Denver probably needs a copy of these docs.
480	Might want to check with him and see if anyone else in Denver needs a copy.
480	Enron North America Corp.
481	Mom, Could you send me a list of eveyone's email address.
481	What to take a poll on activities in Estes that everyone might be interested in. I am doing fine.
481	Hope you guys are doing well.
482	Clement, I had sent you a draft of a guaranty by Enron Corp. for ECS Compression Company, L.L.C.
482	earlier.
482	Have you had a chance to review and obtain execution yet.
482	Please let me know the status.

488	FYI
489	Hi Katie, How are you doing?
489	Did you survive all your projects and presentations?
489	Haven't heard from you in a while and just wanted to see if you made it through.
489	Hope everything is going OK.
489	Gerald
490	FYI.
490	I think there was a temp here the day I sent this letter out.
491	Per your request.
491	Enjoy.
492	Sorry, Sent you the wrong one last time.
492	I will try it again
493	Lost my number eh?
493	A likely story.
493	Just kidding.
493	Sounds like you were pretty busy with family.
493	I had a pretty good Easter as well.
493	Mostly just hung out with friends and enjoyed the weather.
493	Of course I worked in a little jam session with my friends.
493	The week is going pretty well.
493	Been in a lot of meetings and those just suck up the time.
493	I am leaving today at lunch to go to Enron Field.
493	The Cubs are in town and it is an afternoon game.
493	Should be fun.
493	The Astros really stink this year but the field is pretty awesome.
493	I am not a huge baseball fan and but outdoor baseball in Houston is pretty cool.
493	Good luck on the remainder of your schoolwork.
493	My numbers are: Take care, Gerald
494	Attached is the summary of ENA's take obligations under all the purchase agreements to date in the Powder River Basin.

499	Andy, Attached is the complete contract.
499	Hope things are going well for you.
499	We should have lunch some time.
499	Have any availability next week?
500	Mark, I received your fax concerning the season tickets.
500	Thanks for quick response.
500	I thought given the short time frame I would just email with my information.
500	If I could get 2 season tickets in my name on the East Side Lower Deck toward the Neuhaus Athletic Center, that would be my preference.
500	Lisa, indicated you wouldn't be able to know what seats might be available until you got all the responses back.
500	If you could email with the seats you have available prior to charging my credit card, I would greatly appreciate it.
500	If the only seats you have would be worse than about the 15 yard line in the area I mentioned above, I have a friend who is a Longhorn Foundation member with 6 tickets in that area at about the 15 yard line.
500	His name is Patrick McDonald.
500	If possible that I could attach 2 more season tickets to his without affecting the location of his seats, that would be great also.
500	I don't need OU tix.
500	My credit card number is 4305 7216 5689 6359 Expires 2/28/02 Visa.
500	If you really need the form filled out, just let me know and I will forward it.
500	Thanks for your help.
501	Why am I being used as a bargaining piece in this saga?
501	The thing that really scares me, is if I show up I am sure I will be selected to be on next years Family Reunion Committee.
501	Hmmm.
501	Okay, I guess I can make the sacrifice.
501	I believe I will have a 3 day weekend at that time.
501	Should work out.
501	I think the cocktail party on June 23 will work out.
501	I have got a lot of things going on right now that would make it tough to get away right now for the 13th.
501	Talked to Mom about the flyfishing.
501	Sounds like they aren't sure what they really want to do.
501	They are supposed to get back to me.
501	You know Mom, avoid the things that intimidate you.
501	Anyway, hope everything is going well for you and with the wedding plans.
501	Talk to you later.
502	Attached is a draft of the turnkey construction contract for your review.
502	Ron, As we discussed, Exhibit A - Scope of Work will need to be included.
502	Please note the following points: 1.
502	Liquidated Damages - Need to assess a value for these damages.
502	2.
502	Force Majeure - This would currently provide EE&CC with relief from the In-Service Date requirements and consequently, the LDs.
502	Is this acceptable?
502	3.
502	Permitting - Need to specify in Exhibit F, those permits that ENA would secure, and make EE&CC responsible for any others.
502	4.
502	Utility Coordination - Currently this is very generally.
502	Are there specific responsibilities that should be stated in this Agreement wrt the Utility?
502	Please review with these in mind.
502	I will be out tommorrow and Friday.
502	Let's plan on meeting Monday to discuss the draft.
503	Are you moving floors or just moving around on 31?
503	I don't want a lump of coal from you at Christmas.
504	Katie, Are you still out there?
504	I tried to email you a couple of times last week, but they wouldn't go through for some reason.
505	Thanks for your help.
506	I am doing good.
506	I was out for 4 days (Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun) of last week.
506	Just got back from Mexico.
506	Playa del Carmen, which is about 45 minutes south of Cancun.
506	Sun, beach, drinks, party and scuba (Not necessarily in that order).
506	It doesn't get any better than that.
506	Had a great time.
506	Congrats on 23!
506	Yes, you are still very young and don't let anybody tell you otherwise.
506	When you join the business world, you will be fighting the image that you are too young to be taken seriously.
506	Dunk the ring tradition?
506	You have peaked my curiosity!
506	You will have to give me the full rundown on exactly how wild that tradition is.
506	Are you moving back to Katy for the summer?
506	What are your plans?
506	School, work, etc. Take care and talk to you later.
506	Gerald,
507	Mark, Attached is the supplement to the Gas Letter for your review.
507	Do you have Patti's email.
507	We need to forward this for her review as well.
508	Patti, Attached for your review is a draft supplement to the Gas Price Letter which increases the gas that TW delivers to the LLC by 2585 mmbtu per month.
508	We need to move forward and have TW execute ASAP to capture existing gas pricing, therefore I am only forwarding this document for your review at this time.
508	There will be more to follow.
508	Please contact myself at (713) 853-3512 or Mark Knippa at (713) 853-3463 with any questions.
508	Thank You.
509	Cynthia, Sorry about the way I left last night, but I needed to leave abruptly or I felt I would have lost it even more.
509	You are right.
509	This is a very difficult time in my life.
509	However, I want you to know that you are a very special person to me.
509	The more I get to know you the more I realize that we are very similar is so many ways and I think that is why we hit it off so well so very quickly.
509	I wish I could throw everything I have into a relationship with you, but right now there is just too much anger, mistrust, and hurt in my emotions to allow that.
509	All of these feelings result purely from a person I was so close with and trusted so dearly and who treated me worse than I could have imagined.
509	These feelings have nothing to do with you and I am sure you likely don't understand it all fully.
509	I am not sure I understand it fully.
509	I fear I am making a big mistake, because I know you won't be available long.
509	You have so much to offer, beautiful, intelligent, funny, and someone who can give as much to a relationship as you need from a relationship.
509	All of these qualities made it so very easy to be taken with you when we orginally met.
509	When I started sensing some of my destructive emotions, I freaked out because I knew we were becoming very close and it pained me to realize that I would hurt you.
509	So I completely pulled back, thinking I should cut it now than risk making it harder in the future.
509	Believe me, it is not easy to stay away from you, because even though we have only known each other a short time, I miss you and think about you a lot.
509	It would be hard to still see you and know you were dating others because I know I would react strongly as you witnessed at Senor Frogs that night.
509	My kidding you about Lee, I will have to admit, also shows my insecurity about that.
509	Mexico was so wonderful, because (except for that one night) I was able to put all of those emotions out of my mind and just focus on you.
509	I think that is why we had such a great time.
509	Cynthia, when we were together on that trip, I felt a lightness that I haven't felt in a long time.
509	You looked so beautiful and sexy in that swimsuit by the bar, and it was all about us and nothing else.
509	I have been through it enough to know that reality of my situation creeps back eventually.
509	Cynthia you are such a great person and even just typing this note I feel like crying.
509	Sometimes fate is a wonderful thing and sometimes it feels like a cruel joke.
509	I think the timing of our meeting was ill fated.
509	I know we will talk to and see each other again but I know it will be different now.
509	As much as I want to hold on to you, I know its stupid to attempt to keep you close and yet at some distance.
509	You have are too smart and have too much to offer to put up with that.
509	Please know that I do have genuine feelings for you and I miss you.
509	Gerald

524	Thanks.
525	I will get something to you within the next couple of days.
525	Should be a straightforward letter agreement.
525	Eric, Let's discuss in the morning.
526	Please see the attached.
526	I am still trying to obtain the DOE reports for Canada from Juanita Marchand for Question #19 of the Pan Alberta.
526	Any help you could give me there would be greatly appreciated.
527	Couple of Coca-colas?
528	Here are the revised responses with your suggested changes.
529	Attached are the reports to be attached for #20 of the Pan Alberta Request.
529	Please note that there are 3 sheets in each files which report different volumes.

529	One report for each quarter of 1999.
529	Please let me know if you have any questions.
530	Becky, Attached are the revised responses per your voice mail.
530	Let me know if you need anything else.
531	Were you able to confirm that they received our Fedex?
532	Bruce, Attached is the information for the property settlement.
532	Sorry, it took so long.
532	I am still missing Lisa's vehicle VIN # and Loan information for that vehicle.
532	We can fill that in after we review the paperwork you have drafted.
532	Gerald's Car Loan on Gerald's Car Loan #1221609900 with USAA House Description 1403 Banks House Loan Washington Mutual Stock Options to be transferred to Lisa from Gerald 626 Options at Grant Price of $15.25 per share 268 Options at Grant Price of $22.25 per share Let me know if you need anything else.
532	I think we are ready to review the doc as soons as you get done.
532	Thanks.
533	Chris, My comments are as follows: 1.
533	The term (Article 4) was revised from the previous draft (month to month) to now being a definitive term with no evergreen provision.
533	Is this acceptable commerically?
533	Should we add an evergreen provision on to the end of the current definitive term?
533	2.
533	Section 9.9 - Doesn't give a time frame for this approval process.
533	Hattiesburg has no obligations under this agreement until this approval occurs.
533	What if it doesn't occur for 3 years?
533	Need either (i) ability to walk away from this agreement if not done by date certain, or (ii) assurances from Hattiesburg that this is a short process or has already been accomplished.
533	3.
533	Definition 1.2 in the GTC of "day".
533	Does this day match the gas day for the interstate pipelines?
533	If not will this cause problems in scheduling.
533	4.
533	General Comment: Does this interruptible agreement provide the level of service that this power plant will commercially require?
533	Hattiesburg can interrupt service at any time at its discretion and furthermore, never provide service under this agreement by indicating to Caledonia that its storage capacity is full with other storage committments.
533	Does this work?
534	Ken, Attached is the form of services agreement for Ted Huss.
534	In the interest of time, you can print out two executables for Ted's signature and then return to me for initialling for Brian's signature.
534	Let me know if you have any questions.
535	Let's talk about this one also when you get a chance.
536	GT, How is it going brother?
536	Got that house finished yet?
536	Wanted to see if you were going to be in town for the Memorial Day weekend.
536	I was kicking around the idea of doing some tubing and maybe stopping by Austion for a night to chase some good looking Austin women.
536	Drop me a line.
537	Could you get with Candy on this and provide her what she needs.
537	Let me know if you need any help.
537	Thanks.
538	Mary, Here is another one from Candy.
538	Might want to check with AEW to make sure she hasn't taken care of this already.
538	Thanks for your help.
539	I am trying to compare the CA1 doc with the CA doc.
539	Thanks for your help.
540	GT, Congratulations on the engagement!
540	Hate to see a good man go down, but it happens to the best of us.
540	Sounds like things are going really well for you.
540	When is the wedding?
540	Sounds like there are a lot of wedding bells in the Townsend family these days.
540	With respect to the weekend; change of plans.
540	I will be staying in Houston this weekend.
540	However, the following weekend myself and the red-faced Eric and possibly his wife want to come to Austin to hang out.
540	Are you around that weekend and could you handle 3 people crashing at your place.
540	If its a problem let me know.
541	Attached is a revised construction agreement (redlined version) incorporating the changes we discussed.
541	I have not changed either the liquidated damages or force majeure provisions at this point.
541	Ron, you indicated in your voice mail that you wanted to wait until things firmed up a bit more with respect to those provisions.
541	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
541	Not sure if we should forward to EE&CC at this point yet, given the uncertainty on the two provisions.
541	What are your thoughts?
541	Thanks
542	Heidi, I have reviewed the contracts and the amendments and the following is their status: Term: Month to Month and may be terminated by either party with 10 days written notice prior to end of the month (But see rate section below) Rate: Agreement was amended on April 1, 1999 to put a flat rate of $0.085 for all receipts at Thompsonville (Meter #6351) through March 31, 2006 (This language would override the month to month term) No other Points of Receipt are allowed under this contract.
542	Note: Prior to the Amendment on April 1, 1999, the $0.01 fee escalator was still in effect for any volumes moved under this contract prior to the Amendment.
542	If the escalator wasn't assessed during that time, it should have been.
542	This escalator would have applied to all receipts and fees on the original Exhibit A to the contract.
542	Term: In effect through March 31, 2006 Rate: Those set forth on Exhibit A as amended on April1, 1999 for the terms set forth on Exhibit A. Let me know if you have any questions concerning the above summary.
543	Brad, Can you give me a status on where you are at with the review of the Lease Docs for the MEGS Facilities?
543	I forward those documents about a month back.
543	Gerald Nemec Enron North America Corp. - Legal
544	Greg, Have you had a chance to review this document yet?
544	Any comments?
545	Bruce, The legal description for my house is as follows: Lot 27 Ranch Estates, an addition in Harris County, Texas according to the map or plat thereof recorded in Volume 22, Page 68 of the Map Records of Harris County, Texas.
545	Thanks
546	How is it going out there brother?
546	Been keeping your sanity while living at home?
546	Things here are about the same.
546	Talked to your boy Tree the other day.
546	He had some interesting new developments in his love life.
546	Of course they were sordid and made me somewhat uncomfortable.
546	Well sort of.
546	Your furniture is still almost completely intact.
546	The longer you stay out there, the better my chances of picking up some furniture real cheap.
546	Haven't seen that much of Janel lately.
546	She went out to Florida this weekend to convince a gay guy that the opposite sex is not icky after all.
546	Should make for some interesting stories when she returns.
546	Drop me a note when you get a chance.
546	Talk at you later.
547	Check out the attached response from Marathon concerning our revisions.
547	I guess this is a new negotiation technique.
547	Just ignore the counterparty's concerns.
547	Let's discuss this before I call Brad back.
547	Thanks.
548	Richard, The attached resume is from an attorney who is a friend of an Associate here at Enron.
548	I had worked with the Associate before but don't know his friend.
548	I told the Associate that I wasn't sure of our hiring needs, but that I would pass the resume along.
548	Barbara indicated you were our recruiting coordinator.
548	So here it is.
549	Lori, Thanks for the diskettes.
549	The one disk did have the final version of the Agreements.
549	The other disk had earlier versions of the docs.
549	I will use the final versions to develop the amended and restated agreements.
549	Should have drafts for BR's review later this week.
549	Do you want these diskettes returned?
549	I talked to Shonnie about any amendments to the LLC and Capacity Allocation Agreements, and she wasn't aware of any.
549	I don't think those 2 agreements were revised unless you have other information.
549	Let me know.
549	Thanks, Gerald Please respond to lmarlatt
550	Lauri, Per my voicemail, the attached docs outline the elements for comparable shippers in the RailRoad Commissions eyes.
551	Richard, I wouldn't worry about a letter.
551	It was a very informal submittal.
551	I will let my Associate friend know.
551	Thanks.
552	I have reviewed your response and disagree with the characterization of our modification the documents.
552	I would like to clarify our reasons for the modifications to avoid any further miscommunications.
552	MEGS' alteration of the documents do not impair the protections afforded to Marathon under the Production Handling Agreement.
552	Our modifications were simply intended to allocate certain risks between MEGS and Mariner with respect to Marathon (as operator of the South Pass 89 B Platform) as such risks were intended to be allocated by MEGS and Mariner.
552	Mariner's transfer of interest in the flowline to MEGS introduces a new party which Marathon can look to for certain obligations with respect to the platform.
552	The alterations do not remove Mariner from its current role as operator and maintainer of the flowline and owner of the hydrocarbons.
552	For these reasons, I would disagree with your response that the draft alterations do not provide the intended protections that Marathon would expect absent such a transfer to MEGS.
552	Mariner still shoulders these risks and expenses under the Production Handling Agreement.
552	Having MEGS fully ratify the Production Handling Agreement and becoming jointly and severally liable to Marathon is not appropriate.
552	MEGS does not hold title to any hydrocarbon production or operate the facilities and should not be liable for all risks and expenses associated therewith.
552	Mariner should continue to shoulder those risks and as before.
552	I would be happy to discuss your issues with our Platform Lease revisions at your convenience or to discuss the above further.
553	I had actually called you before I had seen this email.
553	I wasn't involved in the NOx emissions deal.
553	I don't think legal was involved at all, at least from a Compression Services perspective.
553	Mark Courtney was the deal maker for Compression Services and I believe that John Scarborough, an analyst was also involved.
553	Let me know if you can do lunch tommorrow and I can tell you exactly how exciting my weekend was.
553	See ya.
554	Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Capacity Allocation and Expansion Determination Agreement.
554	I will follow with the LLC and Administrative Manager Agreement, however those changes will be minor.
554	The substance is in this Agreement.
555	GT, Looks like I will be hitting town on Saturday morning.
555	Eric and his wife will be with me.
555	We will come by your house in the morning, probably around 10 am or so to group up.
555	Let me know if everything is still a go for you this weekend.
555	I will probably need directions to your house again.
555	I don't remember how to get there from the last time.
556	Do you have any type of pro forma agreement that she refers to?
557	Attached is Marathon's response to our email.
557	I will call Brad to set up a telephone conference.
557	Ted, Steve asked that I forward this information to a lawyer at Burlington, but couldn't recall the name.
557	Do you have any contact information for Burlington.
557	Thanks.
558	Candy, We are working on a draft and should have something for you early next week.
558	Sorry for the delay.
559	GT, Yea, he realized that as soon as we got to San Marcos.
559	Can you mail it Next Day Air also called Priority Mail?
559	I will pay you back next time I am in town.
559	His address is: Eric Gillaspie 1007 Bay Oaks
560	Please see attached.
560	Thanks.
561	Attached is the draft CA for Intergen.
561	Note that there are still several blanks in the Agreement that I need information to complete.
561	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
562	Greg, Attached is correspondence between Marathon and Enron (MEGS) concerning the revised draft of the lease that I had forwarded for Marathon's review and also to you for Mariner's review.
562	I wanted to give you the benefit of these discussion we have had with Marathon concerning how the MEGS and Mariner's responsibilities should be split.
562	Our intent with these revisions, and the our goals as we continue to work with Marathon on these issues is to simply allocate the risks between Mariner and MEGS with respect to Marathon, as Mariner and MEGS intended them to be allocated under the O&M Agreement between the two.
562	We are not asking Marathon to rely on the O&M Agreement to which they are not a party.
562	Risk associated with ownership of the flowline should run to MEGS and risk associated with the operation and maintenance of the flowline and ownership of the hydrocarbons should run to Mariner as they currently do under the Production Handling Agreement.
562	We intend to work with Marathon toward this end.
562	If you have any comments concerning these discussions or would like to discuss this further with me, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.
562	I would also be interested in any comments you may have with respect to the draft lease agreement I forwarded to you earlier.
562	Thanks.
562	Gerald Nemec
563	GT, Thanks for taking care of the ring and thanks again for the hosptality.
563	I will be back in not too long.
563	See Ya
564	How is it going?
564	Did you have a fun weekend?
564	My weekend was, although enjoyable, challenging.
564	First Eric's wife got sick Friday night and wasn't able to go out the whole weekend.
564	Next, my car battery completely died when I arrived at my friends house in Austin.
564	I replaced the battery and everything was fine.
564	Eric, I, and my friend proceeded to Maggie Maes to see the band Pale (the whole point of our trip, right!).
564	We arrived at Maggie Maes and asked which level Pale was playing on and were informed they had cancelled.
564	Great.
564	Oh well we had a good time that night anyway.
564	Cool.
564	Then, driving back to Houston and coming up upon the Beltway I noticed that my temp gauge needle was buried deep into the danger zone.
564	I had to have the car towed back into downtown.
564	Anyway, it was an interesting trip.
565	Staci, Attached is the amendment.
565	Please forward your revisions for my review.
565	Thanks.
566	Got my car back.
566	$700 to fix.
566	Ouch!
566	I am really just glad it wasn't worse.
566	When I stopped my car it was really smoking and I was afraid I had burned my moter up.
566	Eric was providing my transportation during the absence of the car.
566	What a great guy.
566	Yes, we should try to hook up this weekend.
566	The only thing I have going right now is a party that one of the attorneys in my group is throwing Saturday night.
566	Hopefully I will be able to get out of there fairly early.
566	Let's talk before the weekend to try and work something out.
566	I am interested in discussing the Anne situation with you also.
566	Talk to you later.
567	Here it is guys.
567	Still checking for any cleanups, but in interest of time I am forward for your review.
567	It is redlined against the previous revised version.
568	Attached is a redlined version of the agreement with the revisions.
568	Some revisions beyond those we discussed with BR were made strictly to clear up inconsistencies in the original document.
568	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
568	I plan on being at the Member Meeting in Denver next week, but please call any time prior if you wish to discuss.
568	(713) 853-3512.
568	I will be forwarding the LLC and Administrative Agreement with revisions tomorrow.
568	The revisions to these docs are slight and only made to reflect the be consistent with the substantive changes in the Capacity Allocation and Expansion Determination Agreement.
569	I should have a draft for you by Friday.
570	I won't be able to make it.
570	I will be in Denver getting back late that evening.
571	Carolyn, Can you send me a copy of this document for our files.
571	Thanks.
572	Attached is the term sheet with my revisions.
572	Let me know if you have any questions.
573	FYI Attached are the FERC materials we discussed earlier concerning third party ownership of compression in interstate pipes.
573	I will continue to research and see what might work.
574	Attached are redlined versions of an amended and restated LLC agreement and an amendment to the Administrative Services Agreement.
574	I decided to simply amend the Admin.
574	Agreement since the change was so minor.
574	You will note that the changes in the LLC Agreement were solely to accommodate the revisions made in the Capacity Allocation Agreement which I forwarded earlier.
574	Please call if you have any questions.
575	Cris, Attached are redline versions of revisions to the Lost Creek Capacity Allocation and Expansion Agreement which we had discussed some time back.
575	The changes were made to accommodate several goals, but the one that you should have any concern with are in Section 2.3 and the definition of Third Party Gathering Agreement.
576	Rob, Attached are redlined versions of the Lost Creek Docs displaying the revisions we had discussed some time back.

578	He is engaged now and I think he will get married March of next year.
578	Met his fiance and she is really nice.
578	I received Jacob's B-day invitation in the mail this week.
578	Please let Janice know that I am sorry but won't be able to come down for the Party.
578	I will be coming down for the family reunion on July 1.
578	I will see the kids then.
578	I guess Sharon and Will are planning on coming down for the reunion also.
578	I will probably be there late Friday night.
578	Take care and talk to you later
579	Kay, Please see attached.
579	Thanks.
580	Ned.
580	Attached is the CA with some comments incorporated.
580	Please let me know if you have any questions.
581	Attached is the NNG Termination Agreement, clean revised CSA Agreement, and redlined revised CSA Agreement.

582	Jaime, This CA accidentally was sent to you with choice of law being New York.
582	It should be Texas law.
582	If Questar has seen this doc., we need to let them know.
582	Thanks.
583	Attached is a redlined revised agreement based on my discussions with Hoekenga Thursday.
583	James, We still need to talk about our Commercial Management activities in the Madden Field area and how those should be limited.
583	That change would be effected in the LLC Agreement.
584	I talked to Susan last Friday and she gave me her changes which I put into the doc.

587	All other docs.
587	are redlined against the originals.
587	2.
587	Due to the Credit Agreement structure, portions of the Natural Gas Fuel Liquidation concept were placed into the Administrative Services Agreement.
587	This was done in order to allow that portion of the Natural Gas Fuel value which covers the Power Bill to be included in the Debt Service Coverage Ratio calcs in the Credit Agreement.
587	The remainder of the Natural Gas Fuel will be distributed under the Capacity Allocation Agreement to avoid the inclusive of these excess amounts in any distribution tests under the Credit Agreement.
587	3.
587	Since more significant changes were made to the Admin.
587	Services Agreement, it is now being amended and restated.

598	These are all the operational docs.
598	required for the amendment.
599	For completeness, Attached are the operational documents that reflect the Gallup Amendments.
599	The Gas Price Letter reflects TW's agreement to provide incremental gas volumes.
599	The confirms to the existing Enfolio deals reflect the value for the gas which flows from Enron North America Corp. to Enron Compression Services Corp. and finally to the LLC.
599	The confirms done with the original Gallup Transaction are not being amended.
599	New confirms are being added to handle the incremental gas from TW.
599	Please let me know if you have any questions.
600	Bob, Attached is the form of Agreement we need to use for ForeRunner.
600	It is the same form we used for High Mountain.
600	We need to make sure it reflects design and engineering services provided.
600	We will also need a Tasking Letter.
600	Ken Choyce should be able to provide a contract at ForeRunner as well as scope of work.
600	Let me know if you have any questions.
600	Thanks.
601	Attached are the redlined revised docs and a new letter agreement for the payment of the $2 mil.
602	Dan, I have reviewed the Wildhorse (Mesa) Gathering, Processing, and Transport Agreement.
602	This agreement is still valid and the gas is dedicated to this Agreement through 2013.
602	The agreement present some problematic issues which I will outline.
602	1.
602	Gas Quality - The gas quality provisions only require Wildhorse to transport the gas if the gas meets the downstream carriers (in this case Northwest Pipeline) gas quality specifications.
602	We propose to put in a treating plant which would allow the gas to meet the specifications, however there are no provision in this Agreement which allow us to insert a plant between Northwest Pipeline and Wildhorse.
602	Wildhorse could delay are extract value from us for this connection.
602	This is an uncertainty.
602	2.
602	Wildhorse Obligation to Perform - Based on my understanding of the facts, at some point during the term of this agreement, Northwest Pipeline enforced their gas quality specifications and refused to take the gas at the downstream side of Wildhorse's Gathering System.
602	As a result, Wildhorse shut in Enogex's production and it has been shut in ever since.
602	Wildhorse has a right to do this under this Agreement (see #1 above) and therefore Wildhorse has not breached its obligation to transport under this Agreement.
602	Wildhorse's obligation was suspended when Northwest refused receipt of the gas.
602	3.
602	Unprofitability - Assuming Wildhorse worked with us to install the treating plant which conformed the gas to Northwest Specifications, they could refuse to provide gathering service under this agreement if it was still uneconomical for them to do so.
602	If they decided it is uneconomical for them to do so, they have the right to provide Enogex with various potential solutions which include (i) renegotiating the terms (ii) allowing Enogex to operate Wildhorse's equipment at Enogex sole cost, expense and risk, or (iii) release the gas from the Agreement.
602	The problem here is that there is no time limit under which Wildhorse must reach a solution with us and no specific solution they must reach.
602	Wildhorse could drag this out for some extended period of time and they could extract significant value.
602	My recommendation is that we make Enogex's resolution of these issues with Wildhorse a condition precedent to closing and funding this deal.
602	I know the timing is late.
602	However if Enron funds this deal and takes on the risk of negotiating with Wildhorse to resolve either a new deal or a release of the gas, everyone needs to understand that such negotiation could take substantial time and Wildhorse will have significant leverage.
602	Let me know if you wish to discuss this further or have any questions.
603	Have a great trip and try not to hook up with too many Italian hotties!
603	Must come back with lots of pictures and potentially a few life changing experiences.
604	Attached are executables for the Hubbard Transaction.
605	Heidi, Attached is the modified confirm form.
605	Please note the following: 1.
605	This will only work with an Interruptible all points master contract 2.
605	This confirm cannot extend the term of a transport agreement.
605	We need to make sure that the master is still in its term.
605	3.
605	The counter -party should sign off for every transaction.
605	Via fax signature is acceptable.
605	4.
605	A single form per contract must be used.
605	5.
605	This form is set up for 1 month or less deals.
605	We need to make sure this confirm can be handle under the existing global contract # for the master contract.
605	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
606	Fyi, Attached is Marathon's Response.
607	Check's in the mail.
607	Sorry for the delay, I will review today.
608	Chris attached is a clean and redline version of the Gregg Agreement with my revisions.
608	The form Gregg sent was the original form they had forwarded for the first project.
608	I change to reflect the change we made at that time.
608	As you will notice it is quite a few changes.
608	However, since Gregg signed off on this form once already, they shouldn't have a problem doing it again.
608	Let me know if you have any questions.
609	I reviewed the draft you forwarded.
609	Looks good.
609	I have the following two questions: Section 1.1 - The fourth sentence down in the parenthesis "(whether owned or leased by LESSEE)".
609	Shouldn't that read "(whether owned, operated, or leased by LESSEE)" since Mariner only operates the Property for MEGS?
609	Term - Shouldn't the term mirror the term for the Production Handling Agreement?
609	Section 7.1.2.e allows termination after January 1, 2005.
609	Why would Marathon want to terminate while the PHA is still in effect?
610	Sounds good.
610	Pencil me in. Of course this won't be as nice as going fishing to catch those small fish.
611	Eric, Can you pull the FERC document cited below and print it out.
612	Here is the other one.
613	Attached is the cite you forwarded earlier.
614	Here is the other cite.
615	Will, Sharon left a voice mail indicating that you could set me up with a set of clubs on Saturday.
615	That sounds great.
615	I will plan on playing with you guys tomorrow.
615	Thanks.
616	I will review and get back to you by no later than tommorrow.
617	Marlene, I am not sure what you are asking me to do.
617	If these contracts are active then they should be put into whatever is the proper contract tracking system for these types of services contracts (transport, pooling, etc.).
617	If they are not active and are of no value, then they probably should not be put into the database.
617	However, this is not a legal question, but a business question.
617	If the business decision is made that they are of no value and inactive, then they should be terminated in accordance with their terms.
617	Let me know if I am missing the point of your question.
617	If I am not, then I will return these contracts to you.
618	Kay, Please see attached.
618	Thanks.
619	Ruth, Attached is a redline with my revisions.
619	I will be forwarding two hard copies of the revisions to your attention.
620	I will have my comments to you by tomorrow shortly after lunch.
621	Dan and Teresa, Attached is the form of declaration of Managing Member under which Crescendo appoints ENA to exclusively negotiate a gathering deal with Wildhorse.
621	Please review.
621	Teresa, Do you think we need to get the Class B member approval also for this appointment of ENA as representative?
621	The LLC Agreement is open with respect to the Managing Member delegating its duties.
621	Dan or Ward, Please note that the Crescendo LLC Agreement Section 6.3 indicates that if the Managing Member request the Class C Member (Enron) to provide certain financial or technical services, then Class C Member may do so for market based rates.
621	Is it the intention that Enron be reimbursed for any commercial or engineering services it provides to the LLC such as negotiating with Wildhorse or Project Management of the Plant Construction?
622	See attached.
622	Sorry for the delay
623	Attached are redlines of the latest revisions to the documents.
623	Upon your review we can forward to BR.
624	Attached for your review are redlines of the latest revisions to the Lost Creek Documents based on our recent discussions.
624	Please let me know if you have any comments.
625	Looks like he punted to Russell Diamond.
625	Give Russell a call and let him know what we need.
626	Is everything OK?
626	Didn't hear from you.
627	Kay, I would like a copy.
627	Thanks.
628	Scott, Attached is the TransEnergie agreement with my revisions.
628	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
628	If you want executable copies, let me know.
628	Thanks.
629	Attached is a clean and redlined version of the amendment with the changes we discussed.
629	Let me know if you have any questions.
630	Confidential Work Material - Attorney Client Privilege Attached for review is a draft of the letter to be sent to Wildhorse concerning the Gathering Agreement under which the Entrada and Dakota production is committed.
630	Please review and provide comments.
630	To summarize activities to date concerning this Gathering Agreement: 1.
630	Conducted a conference call with Brett Frie on Wednesday.
630	Brett also forwarded some correspondence between Enogex and Wildhorse.
630	The correspondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings conducted between Enogex and Wildhorse.
630	No demands were made by Enogex and no claims of unprofitability were made by Wildhorse.
630	Brett stated that the Entrada and to some extent the Dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because the downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications.
630	Enogex took Wildhorse's word for that and never checked with Northwest or Questar.
630	I asked Brett why he thought Wildhorse would straight away release the gas.
630	He responded that he thought they would do so only if Crescendo negotiated an alternative arrangement with Wildhorse.
630	2.
630	I received more correspondence on Friday from Ken Krisa.
630	Nothing really useful.
630	There was a letter from Wildhorse to another producer in the area called Lone Mountain Production Company which stated that Wildhorse thought these assets were in a state of economic viability decline.
630	Unfortunately this letter was not directed to Enogex.
630	However, the draft letter takes that position with Wildhorse.
630	3.
630	I am securing local consul out of Denver.
630	I want someone intimately familiar with Utah and Colorado law from a litigation and timing perspective to be involved.
630	We may need to seek a declaratory order.
630	We have run into to conflicts with law firm that have represented either KN or Tom Brown.
630	Should have this resolved on Monday.
630	4.
630	Agreed to language on Friday with Ken Krisa and Jim Osborne and the declaration by Crescendo giving power to ENA to negotiate with Wildhorse.
630	This draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas.
630	However, to reiterate, based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right to deem this gas as released under the Gathering Agreement.
630	The fact that the Entrada Gas is not in spec.
630	with the downstream pipelines for inerts, allows Wildhorse to suspend their receipt of this gas without being in default.
631	Joan, The contract states that Wildhorse only has to accept gas from Crescendo that the downstream carriers will accept.
631	Per Brett Frie at Enogex, the Entrada production is 24% Nitrogen.
631	Until the plant is up and running, this gas will not meet any of the downstream carriers specs.
631	I am not sure how we get the Nitrogen out of the gas stream without the plant?
631	The Dakota production was not mentioned in the letter, because I have no facts about the gas quality of this gas.
631	You had forwarded emails last week indicating the Dan Reineke was to take samples at the wellhead and downstream of Wildhorse's plant.
631	Once we have these facts we can send a letter concerning the Dakota.
631	Do you have any info on these samples?
632	Have you worked your way back into the real world yet or are you still adjusting?
632	This week has been pretty busy already and it is only Tuesday.
632	Want to try and hook up for lunch tomorrow?
632	Let me know how your schedule looks.
633	Here is the term sheet.
633	Chris can you give me a complete list of counterparties, with pricing and volume information for each counterparty.
634	Tomorrow at noon sounds good.
634	I have primarily been working on Denver stuff.
634	Although a new project up in Denver.
634	One that I wish I hadn't gotten involved in. I also need to hit the gym.
634	Been thinking about taking Kick Boxing lessons.
634	A good way to take out aggression.
635	Attached is my draft revised term sheet for the producer purchase agreements.
635	Let me know if you have any comments.
636	Forgot to copy you on the original dist.
637	My thought is just to take all this language out and solely leave us on out if we don't get the transport for any reason under the terms of the Precedent Agreement.
637	Counterparty might not go for it, but it would clear this issue up.
638	Attached is the latest version of the Wildhorse Entrada Letter.
638	Please review.
638	I reviewed the letter with Jim Osborne and Ken Krisa yesterday and should get their comments today.
638	My plan is to Fedex to Midland for Ken's signature tomorrow morning and from there it will got to Wildhorse.
639	Please review.
639	Thanks.
640	Short and sweet.
640	Comments?
641	Stop it.
641	You're scaring me!!
642	Attached is the final version of the CSA.
642	Let me know if you need an executed hard copy.
643	Attached are the latest changes to the docs redlined against the originals docs, per your voicemail.
643	Chris, I made one slight change from the versions I had sent to you earlier.
643	In the Capacity Allocation agreement signature block, I am now having ENA sign for section 4.5 as well.
643	Let me know if you need anything else.
644	Ken, Attached is the letter.
644	Please sign and forward the original to Kent Harris via Fedex.
644	We should request a signature acceptance of the letter and a confirmation receipt of such signature acceptance for our files.
644	The letter has a header for Crescendo on it.
644	Not sure if you had stationary for Crescendo yet.
644	Send a signed copy to me and I will copy all the Enron CCs.
644	Gerald Nemec 1400 Smith St. cc Carter Mathies, Don Opersteny, and Steve Huckaby to the same address as Kent Harris cc Tom Dyk and Pete Scherer at Tom Brown Denver, CO 80202 Let me know if you have any questions and thanks for all your help.
645	Carol, Attached is the revised letter.
645	Per the voicemail I left last week, please let me know if there are any issues with us stating the prepay in this letter.
645	Also when is TW expecting the payment to be wired.
645	Need that date.
646	FYI, Attached is the final version of the letter that was sent to Wildhorse.
647	Attached is the latest set of documents which have minor revisions based on my discussions with Chris last week.
647	These have been only redlined against the prior version, not the original versions.
647	Let me know if you want redlines against the original docs.
647	The LLC was not included as no changes were made from the versions already forwarded.
647	With respect to the cash out imbalance procedures.
647	The Administrative Services Agreement (Exhibit B) currently has a rough procedure for such cashout.
647	It is also written such that the Members can adopt a new procedure at any time.
647	If the current procedures are not sufficient, it probably make the most sense to have only a working draft (approved by the members) of procedures in place until we have a few month of operations under our belt to work out the bugs.
647	Scott Sitter will be developing this draft.
647	The development of these procedures can be done outside these current revisions.
647	A final imbalance procedure would be adopted by written action of the members upon development of those final procedures.
647	Let me know if you have any questions.
648	I will be out the 17th and 18th.
649	Arvel, I received your pressure data.
649	Unfortunately the contract pressure is assessed against the 3 year period prior to the Effective Date of the contract which is Oct. 19, 1993.
649	Any chance we would have any such data?
649	Ken Krisa is also checking to see if he has any such data.
649	Also, did we receive any quality information on Dakota production?
649	Thanks for your help.
650	Ken, Wanted to check and see if you guys were able to find any pressure data on Wildhorse for the period of 3 years prior to the Effective Date of the Gathering Agreement?
650	I think Jim was going to look and see if he had any such data.
650	Thanks.
651	Attached is the letter.
651	I am forwarding per Mark's request.
651	Let me know if you have any comments.
651	If everything looks good, let me know and I will create executables.
651	Thanks.
652	Attached is the revised amendment.
653	Chris, Attached are all the latest docs.
653	redlined against the originals.
654	Pat, Please print these out for me.
654	Thanks.

657	Confidential Work Product - Attorney Client Privilege Dan, Our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution.
657	As the situation stands now, Wildhorse's possible responses to the letter are as follows: 1.
657	Declare Unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment.
657	If they do so, then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to Crescendo, one of which is release of the gas.
657	You are right, there is no time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives.
657	That is a risk I pointed out early.
657	However, in our letter to Wildhorse, I proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of 2 weeks.
657	If Wildhorse is not working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we will have to make a choice: A. Go for a Declaratory Judgment to have the gas released from the contract.
657	This will take time.
657	Depending on court docket loads, 6 months to 1 year.
657	B. Inform Wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in good faith and we consider the gas released (contract breached by Wildhorse) and that we will build our own system.
657	Then Crescendo would build its own system and risk a suit by Wildhorse.
657	2.
657	Not declare Unprofitability If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, then they have the obligation under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms.
657	The only complication is that under the contract, Wildhorse's obligation to take the gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate gas stream.
657	Depending on Wildhorse's flow dynamics and our plant placement, Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas.
657	After your field meeting and our engineering assessment, hopefully we will have a better understanding of that situation.
657	If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant.
657	If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, but continues to discuss renegotiating of this deal, I would very directly ask them "under what provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate any fees?".
657	They don't have a right to renegotiate under the contract without unprofitability.
658	Chris, The Amended Firm Gathering Agreements were executed back around July 1.
658	Lori should have copies of the executed documents.

714	Looks like Major is the starter from now on.

717	GT, Man you are killing me with that story of the naked blonde.
717	I almost cried for not going now.
717	Is she still married, because if not I want to propose.
717	Cabo was pretty sweet.
717	Plenty of sun, sand, and women.
717	Hooked up with a chick from Seattle for most of the week and had a great time.
717	We went fishing one day and caught a 100 lb. swordfish.
717	Took a portion of it to a restaurant and they cooked it for us.
717	Awesome.
717	There were tons of Honeymoon couples down there.
717	You might want to check it out.
717	It is a short flight and pretty reasonably priced.
717	They have some great hotels as well.
717	I will be coming in for the Houston game weekend after next, so have my room ready.
717	Talk at ya later.
718	Need your help with an agency agreement per this email.

719	I can print executables if you need.
719	Let me know.
720	That's a good one.

725	Hi Dee Dee OK, It is at about this point in time when my thoughts turn to my next vacation.
725	Jeez, criminy (little Seattle lingo) have I been busy this week.
725	Looking forward to the weekend to chill out a little.
725	No big plans but to enjoy the college football extravaganza on Saturday.
725	Maybe grill some beast depending on the weather and partake of a few sodas.
725	It has been raining here all week which is good, because at least it isn't 107 degrees out.
725	My clients in Denver wanted a full download on all my Cabo activities.
725	These are the guys who have been to Cabo several times including the 20/20 club.
725	As a matter of fact, the project I am working on right now for these guys is called Project 20/20.
725	Coincidence, I don't think so.
725	Anyway, when I told them I met this girl who went to 20/20 with me, they were very impressed.
725	They now hold me in higher esteem than before.
725	At least that's one way to gain the respect of your clients.
725	So how is the great Northwest?
725	Have your told grandparents about the wonderful time you had in Cabo with some strange guy walking around in your shoes.
725	Some details are probably better left out.
725	I am about out of here.
725	Take care and I will talk to you later.
725	Gerald
726	Attached is the revised agreement with Utah added.
726	Let me know if you need anything else.

727	All other supplements to the schedules remain unchanged.
728	Eva, All the references are conditional upon term conversion occurring prior to closing, so they work even though Term Conversion won't occur prior to closing.
728	We plan on leaving the references as they exist.
728	Let me know if you have any questions.
729	Jere, I have reviewed the draft and everything looks fine except for the $10 million cap.
729	Dave and I had discussed a $2 million cap.
729	I would request that the $2 million cap be inserted.

731	I attempted to redline the schedules for the title defects, but it redlined the whole list.
731	The only change of substance added was a new Wyoming DOT road crossing permit to Maverick.
731	Also taken off were references to the documents that have been prepared and sent to Gillette (that information was contained in brackets and began "[See Attached ....]. That information was for the right of way agents in Gillette so that they knew what documents had been prepared for them. Please let me know if you have any questions.
732	Attached are clean versions of the 20/20 Schedules
733	I might have fallen asleep before in church, but fortunately have never turned myself into a human candle.
733	I did spend several years as an altar boy.
733	We got to wear those cool outfits also.
733	How are you doing?
733	Thanks for not rubbing in the loss from Saturday.
733	This is a time of healing right now for me, so be gentle.
734	Hi Kelly, Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner, but have been swamped.
734	I am thinking the South Carolina game works.
734	However, what does a flight to Florida cost?
734	I need to factor that in as well, as I am planning on going to Spain in November and probably need to watch my $$$.
734	I have been to several OU games in Dallas, and it is actually more fun than the A&M game because they split the stadium 50/50 Texas OU.
734	It is pretty intense.
734	I am trying to get tickets to the game this year and will probably go.
735	I will check with my bro, to see if he is interested and let you know.
735	Get some sleep.
735	Talk at ya later.
736	Are you still out there?
736	Sent you an email last week but didn't hear from you.
736	Just checking to see if you are still in Seattle or if you moved down to Cabo for good.
737	Craig, Attached is a short outline concerning the approach we discussed earlier.
737	Please review and let me know if you agree.
738	Hi Katie, Remember me.
738	Not sure if this is still your email address, but thought I would check and see.
738	Hope you are doing well and school is going well.
738	If you are still out there drop me a line!
739	Hi Mom, Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.
739	I have just been pretty busy at work and on the weekends.
739	Seems like there is not enough hours in the day.
739	I did go down to Cabo for a week.
739	It was a blast.
739	We partied way too much.
739	Everything else is going fine.
739	My roommate moved in at the beginning of September.
739	So far so good.
739	Hope everything is going well down in CC.
739	Love yall and talk to you later.
739	Gerald

742	Not sure if it will be Fri.
742	night or Sat.
742	morning.
742	What does your schedule look like for the weekend?
743	GT, I am planning on driving in Sat.
743	I will probably leave Houston around 9 am.
743	Should be in Austin at lunch time.
743	I can't remember exactly how to get to your casa.
743	Can you drop me some directions again.
743	Thanks.
744	Emmye, I seem to have misplaced your work #.
744	Drop me a note when you get a chance with your #.
745	I think Paul is interested.
745	His email address is paul.nemec@williams.com.
746	No need to worry.
746	I won't send that picture to anyone.
746	Now the one with Eric and the smoke hanging out of his mouth will be distributed to ALL ENRON EMPLOYEES.

754	These went to Huber for execution this afternoon
755	Hi Katie, Sorry it has taken awhile to respond.
755	I have been out of town for awhile.
755	Good to hear from you again.
755	I understand about the summer.
755	Sometimes we get so busy and it seems like weeks go by without noticing.
755	I had a good summer.
755	My little sister got married up in Estes Park, Colorado in August.
755	Estes is a neat little town near Rocky Mountain National Park.
755	I spent four days up there.
755	My whole family made the trip, so that was cool.
755	The weather up there is awesome.
755	I played around of golf and I don't think it ever got above about 75 degrees.
755	They had the reception at the Stanley Hotel.
755	This hotel was where Stephen King was staying when he got the inspiration to write the Shining.
755	No weird events occurred at the reception though.
755	I also just got back about 2 weeks ago from Cabo San Lucas.
755	I spent 8 days down there with some friends.
755	Scuba diving, fishing, beach, drinking, and dancing.
755	Not necessarily in that order though.
755	I was a little worried about being down there for that long, but it was great once I got used to partying till 4 am and sleeping til noon.
755	Enron is going well.
755	We just closed another big deal last week, so the pressure is off for now again.
755	There will surely be another next quarter.
755	Can't wait .
755	I feel for you concerning statistics.
755	Actually that was one of the courses that gave me the most problems in engineering school.
755	I must admit I probably didn't try as hard as I should have.
755	I just hated the course so much that I just wanted to get it over with.
755	Hang in there.
755	You will get through it.
755	Is this your last semester?
755	If I remember correctly, I thought you were going to graduate in December.
755	It is really good to hear from you again.
755	Take care and drop me a note when you get a chance.
755	Gerald
756	Attached is a revised nomination letter incorporating comments received.
756	Please review
757	Hi Dee, I am really sorry to hear about your brother's child.
757	I hope everything with you and your family is as well as it can be right now.
757	I will say a prayer for yall.
757	I am doing good.
757	Staying busy with work as you suggested.
757	Actually we closed our big deal last Thursday.
757	That will allow my hours to become somewhat more normal in the near future.
757	They are planning a trip to reward those who worked so hard on this deal.
757	Guess where?
757	Cabo.
757	Went to Austin this past weekend to watch my beloved Longhorns play.
757	They won, fortunately.
757	It was good to see some old friends and hang out.
757	I wouldn't mind moving back to Austin, but the jobs there just don't pay as much as in Houston.
757	Everyone wants to stay in Austin after school, so they can lowball you on the cash.
757	Looking forward to the pictures.
757	Need to refresh my memory of Cabo.
757	Take care and talk to you later.
758	A redlined version with my changes.
758	Let me know if you have any questions.
759	Barbara, I put hard copies of these documents in your chair.
760	Attached is a rough draft of a response letter to Wildhorse concerning the nominations.
760	Barbara and I are still reviewing, so there will be some further changes, but in the interest of time, I thought I would send this out for everyone's review.
761	GT, I think I will probably come in tonight since the game is so early.
761	Are you guys going to try and buy tickets at the gate for BB?
761	Email back with your phone numbers, so I can call if anything changes.
761	Talk at ya later.
762	Sounds like your little cousin is continuing to strike out on the airline tickets.
762	It really breaks my heart to see the once great web master fall so far.
762	Maybe we should have assigned him the task of color coordinating his pants and shirts for the trip.
763	Scott, Attached is the memo from local counsel in Denver.
763	Per Barbara's voice mail, both her and I agree with the content of the memo.
763	Craig is an experienced litigator in Denver.
763	Please review and let's discuss.
764	Sorry for the delay.
764	Here is the letter
765	The pictures were very amusing.
765	Thanks for sending those along.
765	Looks like you guys hung out quite a bit with the neighbors.
765	I especially like the candid shot of me in my Tommy Hilfiger's.
765	Whoa, got to start working out and shed the love handles.
765	I thought there would be more shots of Squid Roe since that is where you guys hung out most of the time.
765	Looks like your Mariners made the playoffs.
765	I really don't follow Texas but I do follow the Astros.
765	I think everybody is just happy the season is over with so we can forget it as quickly as possible.
765	The Astros were pretty horrible this year.
765	Hope you are doing well.
765	Did you keep Julie and Angie out of trouble this weekend?
765	I know that is probably impossible.
765	Thanks for the pics again and I'll talk to you later.
765	Gerald
766	I would call Kent and ask about this.
766	I would also remind him about our request for the pressure data in the September 14 letter and their obligations to keep pressures at the average pressure for the 3 year period prior to the effect date of the agreement.
766	Mark, We also need you to keep notes, with dates and times, of all your discussions and communications with Wildhorse.
766	Dan, Has been preparing his notes and you may want to just add onto his notes.
766	Dan, I also need to get a copy of your notes when you get a chance.
767	Davis, This actually sounds frighteningly like my experience at the Big 12 Game.
767	However, just because I at one time worked at the Posse doesn't mean my character should continue to be called into question.
768	FYI, The call to Kinder may not be needed.
769	Attached is a form agreement for the Oakhill Transaction.
769	Please note the italicized sections of the CSA.
769	I am not sure what the terms quoted to Oakhill have been with respect to interruptions in service and adjustments to energy pricing.

771	Please review.
771	We need to get this to TW asap.
772	I know.
772	I guess we should be used to it by now and learn to expect it.
772	I just need to emotionally distance myself from the Horns.
773	Attached is a draft letter for EE&CC concerning the Station 27 Bid.
773	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
774	I think you need this.

775	The revisions incorporate Chris Hoekenga's comments.
775	Please review and let me know if this looks acceptable.
775	If OK we can forward to BR for their final review.
776	Hello, I am an attorney at Enron North America Corp. I have recently been asked to coordinate our hiring of summer clerks.
776	Monica Jordan previously had handled these duties and informed me that she had used the HBA Minority Committee through which to do some of our hiring of clerks.
776	I am looking for information concerning this program; such as how it operates, when it meets.
776	etc. Any information you could supply would be greatly appreciated.
776	Thanks, Gerald Nemec
777	Did you take the LSAT and kick its butt already?
777	I thought you were scheduled to take that recently.
777	You are probably wishing you have more stuff to study on the weekends.
778	I am forwarding these to you with the condition that you are not allowed to send these to any of your uppity OU cronies.
779	How dare you take such a tone with my counsellor.
779	You're just bitter that you have squandered all rights to your furniture.
779	Face it, your furniture likes me better anyway now.
780	GT, How is it going?
780	Man, was that an ass-whipping or what that we took from OU.
780	Looks like we salvaged some dignity with the CU game.
780	I was planning on coming in for the Missouri game.
780	I might have my brother and another friend with me.
780	How are you set for space.
780	Those guys could crash on the couches, if its not a problem with you.
780	If it is a problem, just let me know and we can make other arrangements.
780	Talk at ya later
781	Hi Katie, You guys would love Cozumel.
781	Short flight, very cheap, and lots of fun.
781	If any of you Scuba Dive, Cozumel has some of the best diving in the world.
781	I had a blast down there.
781	Hope your Stats.
781	class is going OK.
781	Unfortunately, I think that is one of those classes the just requires more effort than most classes.
781	Work hasn't been too busy for me lately.
781	However, I know that will change as we get closer to the end of the year.
781	I do have a trip to Spain planned for November.
781	Some friends and I will be going over the Thanksgiving week.
781	We are flying into Madrid and will also go to Lisbon, Portugal.
781	Other than that we will work our way around the coast on the South of Spain.
781	I am really looking forward to it.
781	Hope everything else is going well for you.
781	Are you sure you don't want to go for your Phd once you graduate.
781	: -)
782	Was curious if you heard anything further on this?
782	I haven't called again.
782	Debating whether I should.
782	Any plans to go up to Estes anytime soon?
783	Attached is the form for assignment of the CIG and Trailblazer PA.
783	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
783	If everything looks OK, these are ready to forward to CIG, Trailblazer, and Huber for execution.
784	GT, Right now it will only be me and maybe my brother.
784	Probably stay both Fri.
784	and Sat.
784	night.
785	Attached please find the amended and restated Cinergy Marketing and Trading guaranty.
785	The guaranty has been revised to increase the amount from $9.5 mil to $15 mil.
785	Please obtain signature by all four managers listed in the signature block.
785	If you have any questions, please call me at 853-3512.
786	Attached for your execution and distribution is the amended and restated Unocal Energy Trading, Inc. guaranty.
786	The amount has been increased from $5 mil to $10 mil and Union Oil Company of California has been added as a counterparty.
786	If you have any questions, please contact me at 853-3512.
787	Attached for your review is the Huber capacity release and re-release agreement.
787	Please provide comments.
787	I will forward the revised Huber transaction agreements shortly.
788	Attached are redlines of the restated Huber confirms with the netting language we discussed.
788	Please review and lets discuss.
789	Kay, Please see the attached.
789	Thanks.
790	Mike, I reviewed the pages to the site you provided.
790	My only comment right now is that the correct name of the pipeline is "Houston Pipe Line Company".
790	Note the Pipe Line is two words.
790	Everything else looks fine.
790	We will be getting back with you on the site access agreement.
791	Mark, Attached are riders to be added to the CIG Confidentiality Agreement.
791	Please forward these for review to the proper persons at Coastal.
791	Let me know if you have any questions.
792	We should again nominate to NWPL .
792	In our nomination we can state that if Wildhorse again wrongfully rejects our nom to NWPL, we then nominate to Questar solely to mitigate damages.
792	I can draft the appropriate letter.
792	Joan or Ken, Will the nominations be done via the web site?
792	Do we have the information to nominate to NWPL via the website?
792	"Ken" Please respond to kckrisa
793	Audrey, Attached is a term sheet that Barbara Gray prepared some time back for the OE agreement.
793	Please review.
793	How does tomorrow afternoon look for you.
793	About 2:00 pm.
794	Wednesday works for me.
794	Morning would be a good time for me.
795	Ken, Our position has been that Wildhorse doesn't have the right to curtail our volumes since we have a first que position.
795	We could draft the letter such that we demand to send 100% of our gas to NWPL.
795	In the event that Wildhorse would only accept noms.
795	50% (or some portion) of this gas to NWPL, we would nominate the remainder to Questar to mitigate Wildhorse's damages.
795	Once they accept the nom to NWPL, they have a first que obligation to move it there.
795	From a practical standpoint, if Wildhorse curtailed us to NWPL (to our protest) after they had accepted our noms., I understand this would cause problems.
795	However, if we nominate gas to Questar when Wildhorse is willing to accept a nom to NWPL, we would potentially be waiving damages there.
795	"Ken" Please respond to kckrisa
796	Hi Janel, We have a couple of things on the agenda.
796	Friday night is Fastball at the Engine Room.
796	We plan on meeting on W. Alabama Ice House prior to the show.
796	Doors open at 9 pm so we will probably be at the Ice House around 7 ish for free dogs and cold beer.
796	Saturday is The Buzz Monster Mash with the Toadies.
796	Some placed called Americas near Enron Field.
796	Never heard of it.
796	There are about 3 other bands.
796	Vallejo, and two others I can't remember.
796	Show starts at 7 pm.
796	Tickets are still available for both shows through ticketmaster.
796	There are about 4 to 5 people going, including myself and Eric as the foundation.
796	If you guys are interested in either or both, more people would be kickin.
796	Let me know.
797	No acid rock, just good easy listening tunes.
797	Fastball had the hit about 2 years ago called The Way.
797	Toadies; they just rock.
797	We will probably dress as under-appreciated, under-paid and fairly disinterested attorneys.
798	I would be happy to handle this, unless you want to.
798	Let me know.
798	Thanks.
799	Can you place these on my calendar please.
799	Thanks.
800	Dave, Attached is a rough draft of the letter we discussed.
800	The right to match option is a little less drastic than the "saving sharing" we discussed.
800	The savings sharing is a little more problematic to enforce.
800	We can discuss though, if that is really the way you want to go.
800	Please review and lets discuss.
801	Attached for your review is a form of assignment for the Trailblazer Precedent Agreement between ENA and Trailblazer.
801	This assigns the PA from ENA to J.M. Huber Corporation.
802	FYI
803	Stick this in your pipe and smoke it, you uppity OU #@$%.
803	Predictions on ?the OU-NU game?????Despite a constant barrage of distracting gossip and innuendo, maybe the most ?famous backup quarterback in college football history is staying put.
803	?Rumormongers, put that on your Web site and read it.
803	?"People don't understand that I have no interest in transferring, and I don't ?want to transfer,'' Simms said. "I'm happy here."
803	?Simms insists he isn't joining his best friend and former high school ?fullback Greg Toal at Boston College, as was rumored by a wildly off-base ?ESPN report on Tuesday. He isn't going to Georgia as speculation at that SEC ?outpost suggested last week. He isn't going to Tennessee, his original first ?choice out of high school before changing his mind and signing with Texas. He ?isn't going to other rumored destinations Penn State or Marshall. ???????Paul.Pfeffer@.com? cc: ? Subject: Simms???Gerald,??Chris Simms is disgruntled and is going to transfer to Boston College at the?end of the season. Pass it on.???
804	Are you sure you want to take such a bold stand?
804	You are kind of throwingmonkeys to the wind.
804	Actually isn't NU red and OU crimson.
804	cc: Subject: RE: Simms In the spirit of George W's response to David Letterman regarding who he favored in the world series, I predict a victory by the team in red.
804	(Bush said he like that New York club)
805	Chris, Attached is a redlined of the revised ENA - Lost Creek IT Agreement.
805	The changes you noted are incorporated.
805	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
805	If this is acceptable I can print executables.
805	Let me know.
805	Thanks.
806	Attached are redlines of the revised Capacity Release Agreement and the Revised Transaction No. 2.
806	Please review.
807	Mark, As far as I know, this hasn't been delivered to TW yet.
807	If you could print this on paper with an Enron Logo only.
807	I already have the ECS header on the document.
807	Steve Harris would be the right party.
808	Attached is a draft letter to Wildhorse for our noms.
808	in November.
808	The letter again reserves all our rights.
808	Please review.
808	Mark, Is the cc list still correct?
809	Ken, Attached is the letter with a few slight revisions.
809	We added Bob Mustard to the cc list.
809	We are all ok with this version.
809	If you are fine with this please fax and mail hard copy as we have done before.
809	If you have any questions, feel free to call me at (713) 853-3512.
810	I am currently working on the draft GTC and revised product descriptions.
810	Should have draft by tommorrow.
811	Hi Sophie, I like the sound of the Trifle described in your email to Mark.
811	I will have extra Sherry on mine.
811	How is it going?
811	I had a great time at the party in Austin and hanging with you at the Brown Bar.
811	I am not sure what I was thinking toward the end of the evening by mixing Tequila and Cranberry, but I guess you have to get creative when the circumstances require.
811	I was moving a little slow the next day and drive back to Houston wasn't quite as pleasant.
811	Did you have a good weekend?
811	I didn't do anything real exciting for the weekend before Halloween.
811	Went to a concert that had 4 bands.
811	One of them is a band from Austin called Vallejo.
811	Heard of them?
811	Now tell me the truth.
811	Do you really like Yorkshire Pudding?
811	Drop me a line when you get a chance.
811	Gerald
812	My comments are redlined into the doc..
813	Let me know if you have any questions.
814	Attached for review are a draft of the GTC and Product Description for the transport capacity transactions on EOL.
814	Please review and provide comments.
814	Carl, If you want to meet to discuss, just let me know when.
815	Please see attached.
815	Thanks
816	Ken, Attached is the CA with my comments.
817	A few interesting deals.
817	Working on some products for Enron's B2B internet trading site.
817	"www.enrononline.com" The site was actually developed out of our London office.
817	Enron House is right next door to Buckingham Palace.
817	Some other trading deals as well.
817	I usually get a pretty mixed bag of projects to work.
817	It has been very busy the last couple of days.
817	Sophie Therapy?
817	That sounds extremely interesting.
817	Is it good for most of your normal life crisis type issues?
817	I might need some now and again.
817	I know you probably told at the party, but as you remember my mental state was not clearest it could have been.
817	Are you a student at UT Law?
817	Forgive me for my mental lapses.
817	OK, I have had Yorkshire Pudding and all I remember was a bland bread type substance.
817	Now the beef, vegetables, and potatoes sounds good to me but not sure about the Yorkshire.
817	Might help to wash it down with a nice pint.
817	Take care, Gerald.
818	I revised paragraph 11.
818	Let me know if it addresses your concerns.
819	I will be attending the lunch on Wednesday for Crescendo.
820	Pat, I will be out Nov. 17, 21, 22, 23, 27.
821	I actually knew all of that information!
821	I was just checking your story to make sure it was consistent with what you told me that night.
821	Everything seems to be in order.
821	Good!
822	If we did sign it prior to getting bank approval, we would likely have to make the WIC portion of the release, subject to the bank approval.
822	Otherwise Huber could be put into the position of having the obligations but being unable to complete it obligation due to a WIC process out of Huber's control.
822	But assuming that was done, I don't see why we couldn't sign the agreement now.
823	I haven't answered him yet.
823	I just plan to let him know that the contracts should be executed next week with the capacity release to occur thereafter.
823	Any thoughts?
824	Mike, Still working on it.
824	Should have a draft by late Monday or Tuesday.
824	Sorry about the delay.
825	Ron, Attached is the assignment with my change redlined.
825	If you want to discuss, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.
825	Thanks.
826	FYI.
826	We are currently executing a CA with Tom Brown to begin review of the system for a possible purchase by Crescendo or Enron North America.
827	That is it!
827	I don't know the how and when, but I intend to devote the rest of my life to bringing down Stoops and the OU football program.
827	You will rue the day my friend.
828	I will remove the open season reference.
828	Some pipeline tariffs do refer to open season for capacity release, but it may cause confusion so probably to remove it.
828	The terms you referenced are defined in the product description.
828	The EOL access agreement makes it clear that the product description is binding on the counterparty.
829	Attached are a redlined revised version of the GTC and the Product Description based on our comments discussions of the previous versions.
829	Carlos, I made a few slight changes to the product description you sent earlier today Please review.
830	Russell, The 2nd Huber transaction was executed and Huber is contractually bound to take assignment of the transportation.
830	We have gotten approval of the assignment form from the Pipeline and expect to execute the assignments and capacity release documents with Huber next week.
830	The capacity release document just specifies the details of the capacity release.
830	Huber is bound by the 2nd transaction to accept our release.
830	I will let you know when these sets of documents are executed.
830	Let me know if you have any questions.
831	I am composing this as we speak.
831	Should have a draft shortly.
832	Carlos, Made one change.
832	Wanted to be clear that Buyer's bid shall reflect the Contract Price, Period of Delivery etc. Let me know if you have any questions.
833	Attached are redlines of the latest revisions.
833	Please let me know if you have any questions.
834	Mark, Attached is the final GTC and product description for our capacity release EOL product.
835	Hi Marsha, How is it going?
835	Nothing really exciting since Cabo.
835	Just work.
835	I am about to go to Spain for 8 days.
835	Should be fun.
835	Amazingly, I may be going back to Cabo in December for a business trip.
835	Don't ask me how I pulled that off.
835	Are you ready to go back and use your time share?
835	Good to hear from you.
835	Tell Shannon hello.
835	Take care.
836	Attached is the final version of the GTC for the EOL Capacity Release.
837	Carlos, Looks fine to me.
837	Thanks.
838	Hi Melissa, Thanks for the call.
838	I thought it might be easier to communicate via email since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.
838	Sounds like they keep you busy at V&E.
838	Yes, I do work for Enron.
838	I am an attorney for Enron North America in gas and power origination.
838	I actually worked with some attorney's from V&E on a couple of asset financing deals we did about a year ago.
838	Terry Yates and David Keyes.
838	Joel Ephross also worked on those deals, but he is now at Enron in our Global Finance Legal Group.
838	Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.
838	I know we keep you guys pretty loaded with work.
838	Who are your Enron contacts?
838	Enron is a big place, but I might know them.
838	Lunch sounds great.
838	The 14th works for me.
838	Any preferences as to location?
838	In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.
838	My sister and Ann are good friends and work at the same school in Dallas.
838	Ann is a trip!
838	Gerald
839	Attached is a redline with the changes per my discussion with Colleen.
839	Please review.
840	Revised GTC
841	Attached is the revised GTC based on the latest discussion concerning secondary points.
841	Attached is a clean and redlined version.
842	One more revision to the GTC.
842	Few changes based on my discussion with Carl this morning.
842	I have attached a clean and redlined copy.
842	The redline is compared against the version prior to the secondary point discussion for Colleen's benefit.
842	I am fine to run with this copy from a legal perspective unless Dick or Colleen had any comments.
843	Eric, The agreement needs to be bi-directional.
843	The subject is an exchange of information concerning Petroglyph's transportation contract Colorado Interstate Gas Company.
843	Paul is going to provide the date of the contract and the contract #.
844	Sorry for the delay.
844	Please review the attached draft.
844	If it looks OK we can send to Ken for execution.
845	Let me just start by saying that if you to knuckleheads (Eric and Jen) would spend less time obsessing about my hair and more time working on your house, then maybe you would have a kitchen that didn't look like it belongs on Bob Vila's "This Old House".
845	Second, the style of my hair is not a pomp, as you "commoners" like to refer.
845	Once we arrive in Madrid, the Madrilenos will recognize me at once as royalty and I should be running that country inside of 2 days.
845	Matt, If you are still gassy by next week, you will be rooming with Eric and Jen.
846	By the way, it should be "two knuckleheads" instead of "to".
847	Attached is the draft.
847	Please review.
847	I left a question about the cash-out index.
847	Please let me know what is appropriate.
848	Miyako sounds great.
848	Why don't we meet there at 12:00.
848	I didn't get to know Terry that well.
848	I was pretty green at that point.
848	That was actually the first deal I worked on when I got to legal.
848	I went to law school a little later in life.
848	I have been practicing for about 2 years.
848	Terry reminded me of an absent minded professor.
848	He had this pair of glasses that during the course of the deal, they became more and more broken down.
848	By the end, one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely stayed on his face.
848	At the closing dinner Enron bought him a new pair of glasses.
848	South America.
848	That sounds pretty interesting, ever travel down there?
849	Joan, I am going to make your noted change and forward executables to Crescendo.
850	Mark, Attached are clean versions of the set of documents to be executed by Huber.
850	The following are redlines copies of the documents that were changed from our prior versions.
850	Mark, A couple of notes: 1.
850	In the capacity release agreement - Are the volumes specified in Section 2.1 correct?
850	Or do these need to be grossed up for fuel?
850	2.
850	In Section 2.4, I took out any requirement of Huber to release WIC Capacity back to ENA if the start date under the purchase agreement occurs later than the start of the term of the WIC Capacity Release from ENA to Huber which we will effectuate soon.
850	Is this correct?
851	Hey, Yes, I am still headed to Spain.
851	I am actually leaving on Friday, so I need to get those tickets to you pretty soon.
851	Let me know what days you are in town this week.
851	The 8th works for me.
851	Where is the Duke party this year?

852	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
853	Mark, Attached are documents for the Huber Transaction
854	Attached are the redlined docs for the docs with changes.
854	I made some more changes to the Capacity Release doc to clean several items up.

856	It would probably be easiest for me to mail them to you.
856	What is your address?
857	FYI, This is how the capacity release product will look on EOL.
858	Mary, Thanks for the invite to the Open House.
858	Unfortunately, I will be out of the country on vacation next week.
858	Have a Happy Thanksgiving.
859	You are very welcome!
859	I enjoyed it.
859	Thanks for the name of the city.
859	We will probably be in Lisbon 2 days, so we'll try to check it out.
859	Thanksgiving in Spain/Portugal should be interesting?
859	Probably won't be able to find turkey, dressing, or american football anywhere.
859	Any fun plans for the Thanksgiving holiday?
860	Hey that sounds like a better idea.
860	I will give the tickets to Shawna today.

865	Hey Melissa, I am trying desperately to do everything I need to before I leave tomorrow.
865	We are in the middle of performance reviews at Enron and I have to review about 10 others that I work with.
865	These are not easy to complete, but I guess I'll get through them.
865	Wanted to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving before I left.
865	Have fun in FW and at the game.
865	That is the hardest part of going to Spain right now.
865	I sold my tickets to the game, but I will be there in spirit.
865	We ought to go get some dinner after I get back.
865	I will be back next Monday.
865	Hopefully I won't have any disaster vacation stories of the type you told me at lunch!
865	Take care, Gerald
866	Hello!
866	Yes, I leave for Spain tomorrow at 1:30.
866	We arrive in Madrid about 8 am on Sat.
866	Morning.
866	We will be in Madrid a couple of days, then spend our time in some towns south of Madrid for about 3 days.
866	The last couple of days we will be in Lisbon, Portugal.
866	Back in Houston next Monday.
866	Should be a good time.
866	I will let you guys know all about it at Christmas time.
866	Sounds like yall had a fun trip to Big Bend.
866	I have wanted to see the McDonalds Observatory.
866	That sounds pretty cool.
866	Anyway, thanks for the updates and I will talk to you as soon as I get back.
866	Gerald
867	I'm back.
867	I will review and comment on their responses.
868	Thanks for handling this while I was out.
869	GT I was actually in Spain all of Thanksgiving week.
869	Took a little vacation time.
869	That game sounds like it was an awesome one.
869	Nothing better than beating the f#$% out of the ags.
869	What's going on with you brother.
870	I have not received this back yet.
870	I will call Ken today.
871	Ken, I sent, via fedex, an agency agreement to you a couple of weeks ago.
871	The agreement appointed ENA as Crescendo's agent to nominate and resolve allocations and imbalances on Wildhorse's system.
871	Wanted to see if you have reviewed and executed yet?
872	Attached is a letter to Wildhorse consenting to the assignment of Crescendo's gathering agreements from Wildhorse to Tom Brown.
872	The letter reserves all our rights for Wildhorse's breach.
872	Also attached is a letter for December nominations into Questar reserving our rights.
872	Please review and provide any comments.
873	The letter looks fine Nicole.
873	Only checked it for form and not substance since I didn't have the agreement to which it is referring.
874	Attached is the letter.
874	Please review.
874	I am still giving it one read over.
875	I made one small change, but this one is ready to go as far as I am concerned.
876	The attached redline document includes the various language changes we discussed today and some other small changes.
876	These are in addition to the action items that EES was going to pursue.
877	This is the latest draft.
877	EES is also making some further changes (discussed yesterday) which aren't reflected in this version.
878	Jere, I have the confidentiality agreements fully executed on our side.
878	What is your address, so I can forward to you for execution by Tri-State.
878	Thanks.
879	Hi MB, Not sure if you are in the office this week, but if you are, wanted to see if you would want to meet for a drink after work today?
880	Mark, I reviewed the CSA for our obligations.
880	They are as follows: 1.
880	ECS will work with the Utility in good faith to establish the online monitoring automatic load controlling system for the No. 21 Schedule.
880	2.
880	If the online system can not be established, then ECS will work with TW to develop a manual system to accomplish the same.
880	ECS will keep TW whole on any costs for incremental manpower required for such manual system.
880	This provision was written very generally.
881	I have reviewed the Oneok Westex Transmission Agreement.
881	The only comment I have is that the daily balance cashout requirements in Section F of the General Terms and Conditions seem very burdensome.
881	This is really a business call, but the 5% tolerance or cashout everyday might be difficult to maintain.
881	I will leave that to you to decide Stacey.
881	I am OK with everything else.
882	No problem.
882	I figured you weren't feeling well.
882	Sorry to hear that you are still sick.
882	You might want to call the doc.
882	I have been able to described my symptoms to her before and she usually calls in a prescription for me (Antibiotics or similar).
882	Good luck with Global Markets.
882	Sounds like you had a lot of good opportunities.
882	I think you will learn a lot by trading which will make you a better originator if you ever want to go back to origination.
882	I am pretty open right now for lunch.
882	Maybe Wednesday.
882	Let me know.
883	Just wanted to drop you a note and let you know I made it back safe and sound from Spain.
883	Spain is really a neat country.
883	Very charming.
883	So I got James' name huh?
883	Who got my name in the drawing?
883	When is everyone coming in for the holiday?
883	I am planning on coming down the 23rd.
884	Dan, Any input you have on this contract would be appreciated.
885	I will draft a letter to Wildhorse concerning the pressure situation.
885	We have previously sent a demand letter on Sept. 29 for pressure data for the 3 year period, with no response from Wildhorse.
885	We need to reinforce the curtailment that the high pressure is causing the resultant loss of profits.
885	I will circulate the letter for review by the group before sending.
886	Attached is my revised letter.
886	Please call with any questions.
887	Attached is a clean and redlined version with my changes.
887	Please note the following: 1.
887	I added back the limitation on damage provision I originally had.
887	We need to be clear that the remedies specified in the amendment are the only remedies.
887	2.
887	Changed both Seller and Buyer Minimum Volume Obligations to be consistent with each other.
887	The amendment for the Powder River contract should reflect the same.
887	Please contact me at (713) 853-3512 if you would like to discuss.
888	Attached is the revised letter based on Chris' voicemail on Friday.
888	I also added a 30 day window during which ENAP must provide the data to Enron.
888	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
888	Note that we still need to legal entity's name from the South America office.
889	We settled up on the tix.
889	You gave me some cash.
889	We're good.
889	I have never been to Acapulco.
889	The only place on the Pacific side I have been to is Cabo.
889	Most people that have been to Acapulco really like it though.
889	Don't worry about the end of the evening.
889	Strange things always happen at 6 am after we have been up all night.
889	Forget about it.
889	Have fun in Mississippi.
890	Alan, Attached is a redline version of the assignment with the changes we discussed.

897	Let me know if you have any questions (713) 853-3512.
897	Please print three executables of each assignment.
897	Thanks.
898	I will be revising the Capacity Release and Agreement and the existing Trailblazer Assignment that Huber currently has to reflect the Transaction just completed today.
898	Mark, you probably should make Huber aware of this if they are not already so.
898	Thanks.

905	They expect work out of me.
905	Imagine that.
905	How goes the job search?
905	Found that position in Hawaii yet?
906	Thanks for your help yesterday.
906	Sorry about the quick turnaround.
907	Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Capacity Assignment and Prearranged Release Agreement and the Trailblazer PA Assignment Agreement.
907	The documents have been revised to reflect the amendment to Transaction No.1 to increase the DCQ by 6, 195 MMBtu per day.
907	A few other cleanup changes were also made.
907	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
908	Can't I say Hello to Mandy without a specific reason for doing so?
908	Actually, you copied me on a joke email earlier in the week.
908	Just thought I would see if you would talk to me.
909	Bill, Per Mark Whitt's request, attached is our form dedicated reserves purchase agreement.
910	Art, Per Mark Whitt's request, attached is our form dedicated reserves purchase agreement.
911	Please replace the prior version of the capacity release with the attached version.
911	I found a typo.
911	In the 5th line of the Section 2.1, the number was incorrect.

913	The WIC capacity numbers were revised to reflect the fuel calculation.
913	The prior numbers were inaccurate.

914	The following are what the contracts state: National Fuels - MMBtu Tom Brown - Based on their stated intent to renegotiate Trend- MMBtu Wasatch - Not stated in contract.
914	Rate is as Wildhorse adjusts from month to month Let me know if you have any questions.
915	Ken, Where are we on this?
916	Jack, Attached is the Release, Settlement, and Termination agreement we discussed.
916	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
917	Lauri, From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an interruptible agreement at our discretion.
917	The contract clearly gives us this right.
917	I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming it is our standard form.
917	I will check this.
917	Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.
917	The fact that this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.
917	Dan, was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if it ultimately ended up at state facilities?
918	I'll check the Global Database to see if I can find it.
918	Did Shonnie paper that purchase agreement?
919	Lauri, I reviewed the contract with TGLO.
919	It is a standard interruptible form, so we should have no issues with interruption of the gas flows.
919	I also talked further with Dan concerning the contract.
919	We feel that the agreement strictly refers to facilities that are directly operated by the state (e.g. universities and prisons) and not school districts.
919	Thus, we would consider HISD to not be state facilities.
919	This argument is not a slam dunk, but we should probably take this approach and see how they react.
919	The contract also refers to gas "destined" for state facilities.
919	So the fact that the gas goes through another pipeline before being delivered to a state facility does not matter.
919	It ultimately is "destined" for state facilities.
920	Thanks for the note.
920	I am also glad we got to know each other this year.
920	We will have to make time to hang out next year, now that your LSAT is over.
920	Have fun in Denver and be careful of who you hang out with up there.
920	Merry Christmas, Gerald

944	There are performance bonuses and penalties for electricity output.
944	We would have to add the steam output.
944	Should be very similar.

946	(If an entity other than ENA has the contract with Gordonsville, the letter should be changed to reflect the proper entity. I removed the discussion concerning demand for cover from Citgo. Per our discussion, we don't have that right under the contract, and since our contract is best efforts, Gordonsville doesn't have the right to demand cover. I think this letter should be strictly a notice out of curtesy to Gordonsville. I am going to be leaving, but you can call my cell phone if you have any questions. (281) 772-9250.

983	No plans for Thursday yet.

990	The agreement has been highly negotiated to this point, but I wanted to get your general view of the structure prior to executing this with Gulf.
990	We are trying to execute quickly.
990	Susan could give you more context on our situation with Gulf.
990	Please call me if you have any questions (713) 853-3512.
991	This doesn't explain Friday night, though.
992	Tana, This isn't something we worked on.
992	I know the NNG and TW have beenusing EOL to auction capacity, so this is probably something the TW attorney's have worked on.
992	Not sure.
992	Let me know if I can be of any help.
993	Pat, Please print these out for me.
993	Thanks.
994	You and Richard had agreed to put in the Feb 28 deadline for providing alternative rates in Sec 1.7 of the PA WE are planning to add the following to the end of the 3rd sentence: by no later than February 28, 2001.
994	we need to be sure to have that information since so that decision can be made within the 15 day window.
994	Otherwise, we may have less than 15 days.
994	Please advise.
994	Thanks Stephanie
995	Chris, The original transaction agreement were done via fax.
995	We only have fax copies.
995	The two amended and restated transaction agreement #2's he sent on Dec. 21 were inadvertently not executed by Huber.
995	I sent them back, but somewhere they got lost in the shuffle.
995	Let's have him execute the copies you left with him.
996	GT, Hey Bud!
996	Sounds good.
996	I am around this weekend.
996	Let me know what's up.
996	G
997	Bill, Attached are my revisions to Tom Brown's PSA.
997	Please incorporate these into your document.
997	I may still have a few more revisions, but wanted to get this draft out ASAP.
997	I will let you know of any other revisions as soon as possible.
998	I am open tonight.
998	Let me know what time you're coming in. I can help you tomorrow too.
998	You can reach me at the following:
999	Per our discussion attached is the revised CSA.
999	I will forward the revised Lease and O&M Agreements (reflecting the equipment change) early next week.
1000	Ken, Attached is a draft of my comments to the gathering agreement.
1000	I have made it clear in the language that the agreement is fully interruptible at our discretion.
1000	The agreement is still a keep whole on the liquids.
1000	I did not change this section.
1000	Also I did not review or change Exhibit A. I will leave that to you.
1001	Barbara, Attached is the term sheet with my revision.
1001	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1002	Attached are my comments to the TBI proposal.
1002	Please review and let me know if you have any comments.
1002	I also wanted to clarify a point on the Tom Brown form of gathering agreement.
1002	The revised form is an interruptible agreement with no acreage dedication.
1002	Since Tom Brown removed all the acreage dedication language, it is my understanding that they were not willing to give us an acreage dedication.
1002	To the extent we modeled our economics on any Tom Brown production, I wanted to make sure everyone understands that these volumes are not committed to the system we are purchasing and can be taken by Tom Brown to someone else at their discretion.
1003	Per your voice mail, attached is the TBI proposal as revised.
1004	Pat, Please print these for me.
1005	Thank You for the Birthday greeting.
1005	Congratulations again to you and Will!!

1007	Can you provide me a copy of the Texaco guaranty?

1025	Are you keeping Mark in line these days?

1028	Please review.
1028	I sending out this draft for the sake of saving time without review by my clients and am asking them to review as well.

1031	Later,
1032	I have received and will begin my review.
1032	When can I expect the coal hauling contract.
1033	Ernie, That sounds cool.
1033	Do you need credit card to book?
1033	I checked out the Acura sites.
1033	Vehicle looks pretty sweet.
1034	That address should be correct.

1035	Thanks.

1040	I revised it to reference the new master to be signed this month.
1041	Mark, Attached is the confirm with my revisions.
1042	Mark, Attached is the revised confirm.
1042	I added a provision which requires AEC to execute a new master as soon as reasonably possibly and upon such execution this TA and all TA's between AEC and ENA in place will be governed by the new Master.
1042	Let me know if that meets your understanding.
1043	That's disgusting.
1044	Per Chris' phone call attached are the suggested changes to the side letter.
1045	Please disregard the version sent earlier.
1045	I inadvertently failed to remove the language in the ( ).
1045	Please use this version.
1046	Per our discussion.
1047	Per Mark Whitt's request I am forward our Enfolio Master Spot Contract and the Confirm with the deal details.
1048	Pat, Please print these documents out and fax to Art McMullen at (403) 234 - 7540.
1048	Please put a note on the fax that I had tried to email to him the docs.
1048	at amcmullen@canscot.com but it bounced it back to me as undeliverable.
1049	Still not sure you actually work at Cox Comm.
1049	since you haven't emailed from that address and my email didn't go through!
1049	I had better do some more background checks.
1050	Mark, Attached is a draft of the CMS Letter Agreement.
1050	Please review and lets discuss.
1050	I am not sure I have the correct CMS entity.
1051	Attached is the form.

1052	Agreement.
1052	The attached riders need to be added to the agreement and the term should not exceed 2 years.
1052	Let me know if you want to discuss or have questions.
1053	Testing.
1053	Testing.
1053	This is a test of the Waldrop email systems.
1053	This is only a test.
1053	If this were a real email, there would be a much more meaningful and heartfelt message contained herein.
1054	Mark, I talked with Jeff Stone this morning concerning the petition.
1054	The petition did not get filed on Friday as planned.
1054	Jeff had left for Tallahassee prior to the FEDEX arriving on Friday morning.
1054	They also wanted to have Katz-Kutter (our counsel in Fla.) sign the transmittal letter for the petition prior to sending.
1054	This way the petition is sent by the customer and not the utility.
1054	Bill Bryant at Katz-Kutter was unavailable Fri.
1054	Jeff assured me that they will get this filed today.
1054	I asked him to call me once filed.
1054	We need to start thinking about the best way to approach WFEC after this petition is filed.
1054	It sounds like Alabama Electric Cooperative is the way to approach this.
1054	Do we know someone in our power trading group who works with AEC?
1054	Might be useful to approach it through that relationship.
1055	Ernie, How is it going?
1055	Did you have a good weekend?
1055	I actually had to work for part of it, so my weekend wasn't all that great.
1055	Were you able to book a room for me?
1055	Wanted to be sure that was taken care of.
1056	Ernie, Thanks for taking care of that.
1056	I will probably be getting into Austin earlier than you.
1056	I'll have my cell phone with me.
1056	(281) 772-9250.
1056	If you get into town earlier, give me a call.
1056	Otherwise why don't you just call me at the room when you get to the hotel.
1056	Sounds great, we'll ride over together.
1056	I might bring this girl I have kinda been seeing with me.
1056	My latest victim.
1056	We'll see.
1056	I believe that's correct.
1056	The wedding is at 7.
1056	Thanks for the Dilliards tip.
1056	I was going to ask about that.
1057	Andrew, Attached is a rough draft of the CSA.
1057	I am still reviewing the version, but it is substantially correct.
1057	In the interest of time I am forwarding this for your review.
1057	Please note Section 3.4.
1057	I am a little concerned about this section from a retail wheeling standpoint.
1057	I am trying to find local counsel in Pa to review this section.
1057	Please review and lets discuss.
1058	Mark, Please review my attached change to the confirm.
1058	This makes it clear that if we don't like their changes to the Master we will not accept them and the existing Master still governs.
1058	If acceptable I will forward back to AEC.
1058	Russell, AEC is reviewing the Master and indicated they would have comments within a week or so.
1058	The plan is now to execute this confirm and follow up with the new master.
1058	The credit language that was in the earlier version has been removed.
1059	I know.
1059	It seems as though Mr. Rudy is in love, so damned the consequences!!
1059	How are you doing?
1059	Work treating you okay?
1059	How is the law school application going?
1060	My Dearest Barbara, I long for the time when I can gaze into your lovely golden brown eyes and lose myself in your innate beauty.
1060	The sheer black leather rockies revealing your strong athletic form tonight will be a wonderful memory upon which I can call upon to see me through any of life's most challenging obstacles.
1060	Sigh!!!!!!!
1060	I plan on leaving for the magical journey tonight as soon as humanly possible.
1060	For who can think of work when one so lovely as Barbara awaits.
1060	I can take journey upon my green Camry steed to pluck the lovely young Ms. Waldrop from those two known as Steve and Gina, and we will abound on towards fate.
1060	Perchance it might be best for Barbara to come seek me out, as I am adrift without direction to the place where Steve and Gina reside.
1060	Yours truly, Gerald
1061	I am doing well.
1061	Staying busy with work as usual.
1061	Wow, your new job sounds like fun.
1061	I wouldn't mind going to NYC once in a while.

1061	Let's talk early next week.
1062	Ann, Attached is the confirm with revisions.

1062	Please keep me updated on the status of the review of the new master.

1064	7:00 pm is fine and I knew you still had a thing for David.
1065	Andrew, Attached is the form of LOI for your review.
1066	Mike, I never did receive a executed copy of the Master and Transaction Agreement between EES and Enron Compression Services Company.
1066	Do you have a copy and could you send it to me?
1067	Jeff, At this point we are considering approaching WFEC and AEC to discuss this with them.
1067	Do you see any potential pitfalls from your side with doing so?
1068	Heather, I did receive the Ash Handling Agreement from Bill White and I am reviewing and should have comments shortly.
1068	I have not received the Coal Handling Agreement yet from Kris' attorney.

1072	Hey Dena, Thanks for accompanying me to lunch today.
1072	I really enjoyed our conversation.
1072	You are very charming.
1072	The rest of this week is pretty crazy and I am going to Austin for my friends wedding this weekend, but would you be interested in getting some dinner sometime next week?
1072	Maybe Wed.
1072	or Thursday evening?
1072	Gerald
1073	That's fine.
1073	Actually I really need to catch up on my sleep and my Napster downloading.
1073	Have fun with your friends and I'll chill out at my crib.
1073	Yes, my face has taken a beating in recent months.
1073	Tell Casey I will live.
1074	Andrew, Attached is the CSA.
1074	I added some language in the HP-hour Charge section concerning the minimums.

1090	FYI
1091	Hi Dena, Hope you had a good weekend.
1091	I went to Austin for my friends wedding.
1091	Got to see a lot of old friends that I haven't seen in a while, so that was cool.
1091	Sounds like your pretty busy these days.

1094	This a form that we used in Wyoming which I modified to fit this context.
1094	I will prepare the tasking letter based on your scope of work and forward shortly.
1094	Let me know if you have any questions.
1095	How is your day going?
1095	Generally manageable around here.
1095	One of the assistants found out I used to be an Iron Maiden fan (technically, I still am) and brought me an old Iron Maiden poster.
1095	Boy is that going to look good in the house.
1095	I know this is really impressing you.
1095	Talk at ya later,
1096	Attached is the tasking letter based on the scope of work you provided.
1096	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1097	The change if fine.
1097	We also need to add the completion date for the services in Part I Section 3.
1097	I left it blank since I did not have that information.
1098	Attached are the Professional Services Agreement and the associated Tasking Letter.
1098	Please review.
1099	I went to the floor with the intention of checking this guy out, but when I got there I felt stupid and didn't really feel the need to pursue that.
1099	I am actually sorry I mentioned it to you.
1099	Insensitive on my part.
1099	It is not a huge concern to me at this point.
1099	How is your day going?
1099	Have you gone out of your way to talk to Cynthia yet?
1100	FYI
1101	Staci, Attached is the CSA with my comments redlined.
1101	Please review and let's discuss.
1102	I would include language which also obligates Calpine to take assignment of the Precedent Agreement with Kern and any associated firm transport contracts and to meet Kern's credit requirements in doing so.
1102	I would propose the following in addition to the Guarantee language; Calpine agrees to satisfy any requirements of Kern River and execute any and all documents as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate, as of the Closing, the permanent assignment/release from Enron North America Corp. to Calpine of (i) that certain Precedent Agreement for Firm Transportation Service between Enron North America Corp. and Kern River dated _______, 2001 (the "Precedent Agreement") and/or (ii) any firm transportation agreements entered into in accordance with the Precedent Agreement ((i) and (ii) collectively referred to as the "Kern Transport") such that Kern River (a) agrees to look solely to Calpine for all obligations with respect to the Kern Transport and (b) unconditionally releases ENA from all obligations for demand/reservation charges, and all other charges related to the Kern Transport.
1102	Obviously there is still the risk that if Calpine doesn't close or meet Kern River's credit requirements, then ENA is still left holding this contract.
1102	If you have any question, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.
1103	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
1104	Sounds good.
1104	I let Eric know.
1104	He's not sure if he will make it, but oh well, I gave him the invite.
1104	Are you still cranking away at work?
1104	Kicking butt and taking names.
1105	I am still working through these comments.
1105	Let me know what you think.
1106	Ann, I have received your comments to the Enfolio and will review them.
1106	Have you received the confirms for the Transaction and executed yet?
1107	Stephanie, I made on small change.
1107	Also attached is the Assignment agreement for Kern River.
1108	It is going fine so far!
1108	We'll see about the rest of the day.

1108	Now I am struggling to even stay awake.
1108	Nap.

1109	Two words about my after work activities.

1113	David knows her, but I don't.
1113	Any idea's on who needs to see this or if Enron is even interested in higher more traders?
1114	FYI, Seems like the number is getting bigger and there may still be more numbers out there.
1114	Let's discuss.
1115	Shut Up!!
1116	I'll be here all week.
1116	Let me know when you receive the letter.
1117	Kay, Please see attached.
1117	If you could let me know ASAP I would appreciate it.
1118	Please see the attached revision per our phone discussion this morning.
1118	If acceptable please fax executed CA to (713) 646-3490.
1119	Kay, Do we have a Confidentiality Agreement in place with this entity?
1120	Terry, Attached is a typical form that was executed.
1120	Specifically Section 3.3 under which we will be curtail are takes from the Producers and any requirements to take pro rata from producers in Wyoming.
1120	Thanks.
1120	Any possibility of getting feedback by tommorrow.
1120	Thanks.
1121	Russell, I am still reviewing.
1121	We are light this week on attorney's due to spring break and I am catching a lot of overflow.
1121	I will try to get through it as soon as possible.
1122	Brant, Attached is clean and redlined copy of the revised Credit Services Agreement with Bridgeline.
1122	I made significant revisions to this document.
1122	In general the document was very thin and needed to be reinforced to provide a more detailed deal arrangement.
1122	Please review and if credit is OK, I am fine to send this to Bridgeline.
1122	Please note that I did leave an open question on the fee structure.
1122	The agreement currently provides for a flat fee of $10,000 per month for the services.
1122	Do we need to be reimburse for any third party expenses to perform the services or would all services be internal and included in the flat fee?
1122	Need to establish this before we send out to Bridgeline.
1122	Let me know if you have any questions.
1123	You are so cool.
1123	I can't believe that the person in that picture with the biggest rock band of all time, was in my bed last night.
1123	Wow!
1123	Everyday I found something out that just makes me want you more and more!
1123	Ha Ha Ha How is Ms. Barbara doing today?
1123	I am weary from the pile of other people's projects couched on top of my head but "I will survive, Hey Hey".
1123	I've lost the edge Maverick, I am holding on too tight!
1124	In case you are not on your work email.
1125	Rock and Roll!!!!!!!
1126	Jean, FYI, I have faxed the executed CA back to Entergy concerning Highland Energy.
1126	They should be good to move forward with discussion.
1126	Let me know if you need anything else.
1127	I forwarded your picture to Eric and your little comment about you wanting to join Quiet Riot has sent shockwaves through the members of Monkey Pump.
1127	First of all, you haven't even been voted into the band yet (seems the chances are getting less likely with you already shopping your skills on the market) and now you already discussing new ventures.
1127	Secondly, Monkey Pump is not a stepping stone.
1127	We are big time and those has beens "Quiet Riot" will wish for just a small portion of our fame and fortune.
1127	I guess this does add a new dimension to the much anticipated VH-1 Behind the Music: Monkey Pump episode.
1127	"Monkey Pump was on its way, they were only 5 years away from their first album, but little did they know that the person who they weren't even really sure they wanted to be their lead singer, already had other designs on reviving a heavy metal icon from long ago. When we return on behind the music............"
1128	Eric and I will discuss this and get back with you.
1128	In the meantime we had better not see you at any photo ops with Poison or Warrant.
1129	Mark, Attached is the letter agreement we discussed.
1129	Please review.
1129	It is rough.
1129	Some issues to note: 1.
1129	The Kern PA cannot be assigned without their consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
1129	If Kern didn't like the fact that we are receiving assignment from 3 or 4 other shippers, they might withhold consent if they thought we were superceding their bid procedures.
1129	Not sure if they would, but it is a risk.
1129	2.
1129	If the assignment is done after the producer executes the firm transport agreement, Kern could require to capacity to be released via capacity release at max rate.
1129	3.
1129	I took a stab at the mark-to-market calculation.
1129	Probably needs more substance though.
1129	Lets discuss.
1130	Attached for your review is a draft letter for third parties whom with we plan to participate in the Kern River Open Season.
1130	Barry asked that I forward to you as well for review.
1131	Per Steve's request, I am forwarding a phone number of a consulting company that produces maps which show all pipeline in Texas (sorted by county).
1131	This might be a good place to start to find the pipeline you described in your voice mail to Steve.
1131	The company is Design Technics Corp. Phone: (713) 460-2291.
1131	The map will generally show where the pipeline runs, but it is depicted at more of a macro level.
1132	Mary, Attached is the list.
1132	Let me know if you run into any problems.
1133	Tyrell, I have made some revisions to the latest drafts of the letter agreement and your cover letter.
1133	Please review.
1133	As I noted earlier, Barry indicated he had some language that he wanted to revise concerning the mark to market.
1133	I have not been able to contact him yet.
1133	So unless Mark and Barry have talked, probably need to hold these until you or I hear from Barry.
1133	Also, if we are going to do any of these transaction with a Canadian party, Peter Keohane and Eric Ledain need to comment on this form.
1133	I have sent them an earlier version and I am copying them here.
1133	I will be in a meeting until about 3:30 pm central and will be available after that.
1133	I again want to reiterate, that if the assignment takes place after the firm transport agreements are signed, Kern could require the assignment to be done via the capacity release bidding procedures of their tariff.
1133	I noticed that one of the packages is less than 1 year in term.
1133	This means it could also be bid up in excess of max rate.
1133	Anything over 1 year could only be bid to max rate.
1133	We may want to add a provision that to the extent the capacity is assigned via capacity release and it is bid up beyond max rate, ENA will have no obilgation to take the capacity and make the mark to market payment.
1133	Probably need to discuss this with Mark.
1134	Do you have addresses and fax numbers for these counterparties?
1135	Attached is the latest draft for review.
1135	We plan on convening and 8 am central time to review and finalize.
1136	I should be talking to Barry in about 10 minutes, and we will probably have a few more changes.
1137	Add these two to the list.
1138	Here is one more.
1139	Great.
1139	Thanks for all your help on this.
1140	Brant, Attached is a clean and redlined version of the revised agreement per our discussion
1141	Yes, I am alive.
1141	Got in a little late, but still here nonetheless.
1141	Deblah who?
1141	I am checking to see if anybody is up for tonight and I should know later this afternoon.
1141	I know we really need to have more drinks, its been so long.
1141	Yes, I was serious about China.
1141	Talked to Eric this morning and they would leave on June 6 and return on June 16.
1141	I need to make sure this works with my work schedule.
1141	I think it would be really cool to see Bejing, the Great Wall, etc...............
1141	and hone my skills as Show Lin High Priest Martial Arts badass......
1142	John, Attached is the Transco guaranty with further revisions.
1142	The following items of note were revised.
1142	1.
1142	Transco added language stating that this is a performance guaranty.
1142	Enron will only provide a payment guaranty.
1142	Enron does not have the means to ensure performance by the LLC.
1142	Thus the language needs to clearly identify that this is a payment guaranty.
1142	As long as Transco gets paid for the transport, I am not sure why this matters.
1142	2.
1142	Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their tariff.
1142	Putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give Transco the ability to recover double interest on late payments.
1142	Thus, the interest language in the guaranty was removed.
1142	Please review the revised guaranty.
1142	I would be happy to discuss these issues with Transco's attorney's at their convenience.
1142	Let me know if you have any questions.
1142	Thanks.
1143	1.
1143	Kern River Expansion Bid - Executed approximately 6 agreements with producers to partcipate in Kern River's Open Season.
1143	Producers were required to bid in Open Season and upon award of capacity by Kern, the producers will assign such capacity to ENA in exchange for 25% of ENA mark to market profit on the capacity.
1143	Overall objective of the project was to increase ENA capacity stake on this expansion.
1143	The basis is currently very profitable between Wyoming and California.
1143	Worked with Barry Tycholiz and Mark Whitt 2.
1143	Enron Compression Services - StageCoach - Negotiating a deal to provide HP Compression Services to Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company in Pennsylvania.
1143	Drafts have been sent to Tennessee.
1143	Also negotiating a power and gas deal with EES to provide electric service to the compressor and sell the gas to EES which ECS receives from Tennessee.
1144	Ken, Attached are the Medusa docs with some slight revision.
1144	The revisions are all to make it clear that this is a nonbinding proposal.
1144	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1145	Debra, This is another one for a Master Firm/Purchase Sale.
1145	The Enron entity in these deals is Bridgeline Gas Marketing, LLC Let me know if you have any questions.
1146	Here is the last one.
1147	Stephanie, Attached is a the form of assignment that we would use for the Kern River expansion with the producer.
1147	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1148	Andrew, Attached is a draft of the Master Firm/Purchase between EES and ECS and its accompany Transaction Agreement.
1148	I think it does make sense to have a separate agreement to encompass the overall annual true between the power and gas sides.
1148	Need to discuss this with EES' attorney.
1148	I will contact Bo and see who is the lead attorney on this deal.
1148	Please review the attached documents and let me know before you send this to EES.
1148	As you will see I have a few question noted on the TA.
1149	How is it going?
1149	I didn't get here until about 9:20.
1149	Yikes.
1149	I had 6 voicemail messages, when I got here.
1149	Help.
1150	Bo, Attached is the draft of the gas agreement for the StageCoach transaction.
1150	There are still a few blanks for which Andrew is getting the information.
1150	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
1150	Also to follow up on our discussion from earlier concerning who would actually contracts with the PPL for the Utility Agreement; we had earlier discussed Tennessee Gas Pipeline contracting with the Utility with EES acting as their agent for interaction with the Utility.
1150	However, I think it should be EES who contracts with the Utility to receive electric service.
1150	TGP has contracted with ECS for Compression Services and ECS has contracted with EES for power.
1150	TGP has no need for a power deal.
1150	Let me know what you think about this.
1150	It is my understanding that EES is working on a revised draft of the TA for the Power Contract.
1150	Let me know if this is not correct.
1150	Thanks.
1151	Dan, Per our discussion, attached is the Compressor Services Agreement between Enron Compression Services Company and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company.
1151	This is a rough draft at this point, but should give you a good idea of the structure of this deal.
1151	Note that Section 3.4 will be removed as this is no longer part of the deal.
1152	Ken, I am forwarding the initialed cover letter with the changes included.
1152	Please revise the body of the proposal to also reflect the changes made to the cover sheet.
1152	Let me know if you have any questions.
1153	That's fine.
1153	Actually my friend Paul called me and wanted to get together for a beer tonight with Andy, so it looks like I will be blowing off working out.
1153	Uh-oh.
1153	That sounds fine.
1153	Tell Shannon hello at the movies.
1153	Ha Ha just kidding :-O.
1153	Can't wait to hear your skiiillz on the radio.
1154	I couldn't have said it better myself.
1155	Please review the attached response to the PSC for accuracy.
1155	Let me know if you have any issues.
1156	Gnny, Please see the bold sentence I added.
1156	Wanted to make it clear that there would be no double interest.
1156	Let me know if that works for you.
1156	I have left a voicemail with Enron Corp. counsel to review this and the other items we discussed yesterday.
1156	Hopefully we can get this settled today.
1156	Thanks.
1157	Some thoughts that might help from time to time.
1157	This was forwarded to me, and I found it very compelling.
1157	Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift.
1157	When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.
1157	The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had.
1157	It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.
1157	Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back!
1157	Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.
1157	It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.
1157	Don't go for looks; they can deceive.
1157	Don't go for wealth; even that fades away.
1157	Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.
1157	Find the one that makes your heart smile.
1157	There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real!
1157	Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.
1157	May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy.
1157	Always put yourself in others' shoes.
1157	If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too.
1157	The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.
1157	Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives.
1157	Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear.
1157	The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.
1157	When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling.
1157	Live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.
1157	Please send this message to those people who mean something to you, to those who have touched your life in one way or another, to those who make you smile when you really need it, to those that make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, to those who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship.
1157	And if you don't, don't worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just miss out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message.
1158	Rusty, Attached is a blank form for use in the E&I work.
1158	The Work Offer form for the other contracts should be attached as an Exhibit to the other contracts.
1158	If it is not, let me know.
1159	Interesting!
1159	Did she say why she was trying to call you at home?
1159	I don't care if you tell where you have been, unless you think it would make things awkard between you.
1159	Probably not a good idea overall though.
1160	Sorry, I should have gone up to gas control this morning when I had still had the shakes.
1161	That sounds good.
1161	Let talk in the am.
1162	Ann, I have completed the review of the comments to the Enfolio.
1162	It might make the most sense to discuss these over the phone to get quicker resolution.
1162	Are you available tommorrow afternoon to discuss the comments.
1163	Attached is a draft of the letter for Phillips Petroleum that we discussed today.
1163	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
1164	Clement, The form of Kern River guaranty is attached at the end of this email.
1164	This is the form we would use for both the ENA bid and the 5 other third parties who have submitted bid on behalf of ENA.
1164	Please review.
1165	That sound cool.
1165	I will schedule it up.
1166	Would it be possible to do this call tomorrow afternoon?
1166	About 1:30 or 2:00 central time.
1166	My morning is a little tight.
1167	Linda, Arthur Anderson is conducted an audit of the subject entity and needs to obtain sign off from ENA Counsel that there is no pending litigation against this entity.
1167	ECS Compression Company, LLC is owned approximately 10% by Enron Compression Services Company, which is 100% owned by ENA.
1167	Attached is the form letter they want us to provide.
1167	Can you review any issues with this LLC and have Richard Sanders sign off on this letter?
1167	The letter needs to go to Jennifer Staton, who can be contacted at the cc email address.
1167	Let me know if you need my help or have any questions.
1167	Thanks.
1168	Julie, Steve forwarded your phone concerning the GTC for EOL transportation capacity.
1168	Attached is the GTC I prepared for the EOL capacity release product.
1168	Let me know if you have any questions.
1169	FYI, Forgot to cc you on this.
1170	Heather, Attached is the ash handling agreement with revisions.
1170	Please review.
1170	I will be forwarding the coal handling agreement shortly.
1170	The changes should be similar.
1170	Redline of this document will follow.
1171	Attached is the redline of the Ash Agreement.
1172	Heather, Attached are redlines of both the Coal Handling Agreement and the Ash Handling Agreement with revisions.
1172	I made a few further changes to the Ash Handling Agreement in the Indemnity Section.
1172	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
1172	Both docs do have a few questions inserted where I wasn't sure if the language accurately reflected our deal.
1172	Sorry for the delay.
1173	Thanks for the review.
1173	A more formal response is not necessary at this time.
1174	My location is EB3883.
1174	Thanks
1175	Hey Ernie!
1175	Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.
1175	I left a little early, so I must have just missed your message.
1175	Did you guys have a good time on Friday night?
1175	How is everything going?
1175	It has actually been thick around here.
1175	Worked several late nights last week to try and get caught up.
1175	I may have to delay the purchase of the new car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.
1175	It did gain some points on Friday and early today.
1175	Hopefully it keeps it up.
1175	Talked to George since his wedding?
1175	Haven't heard anything out of him since.
1175	Probably just overcome by marital bliss.
1176	How was the big weekend in Vegas?
1176	I usually don't have to much luck at gambling but I like to do it nonetheless.
1176	Did you win any money on the fight?
1176	I had a blast the last time I went.
1176	We stayed at the Paris hotel.
1176	Very nice.
1176	All those hotel employees saying "Bon Jeur" every 5 minutes did get a little tiring though.
1177	Stephanie, Attached is the form for the Hunt to Misako assignment.
1178	Attached is clean and redlined version of the Misako letter agreement with revisions.
1178	Please review and if ok have Misako execute.
1179	Please see attached.
1179	I added an agreement by Hunt to assign their PA to
1180	Brant, Attached are the Master Firm agreement that Debra prepared based on your credit worksheet.
1180	I removed the form of Guaranty since we use a different form for the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. and I wasn't sure if we would need a JV guaranty for any of these deals.
1180	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
1181	I'll be there at 7:00.
1181	Barbara is planning on going, but will probably be late.
1181	Around 8:00.
1181	She likely just meet us for drinks.
1181	Is that a problem?
1182	How is it going?
1182	Did you survive the honeymoon?
1183	Clement, Attached is the Enron Corp. guaranty for Transco's transportation agreement.
1183	We revised the interest language to make it clear we are not subject to double interest and put in a limited performance guaranty for the Company's execution of the transportation agreements.
1183	Please review and let me know if you have questions.
1184	That's fine.
1184	I don't think we had anything planned for Thursday.
1185	Ginny, Please see the attached guaranty.
1185	A clean and redlined version are attached.
1185	I revised the language based on our discussions and added the language concerning interest which we had both previously approved.
1185	We are OK to execute this form.
1185	Let me know if acceptable and I will go ahead and execute.
1185	Thanks.
1186	These look fine to me.
1186	Go ahead and forward to Brant if you are ready.
1187	Yes, Please send them to me for my review.
1187	Also please copy Nick Cocavesis.
1187	My fax number is (713) 646-3490.
1188	Dutch, Attached is a draft GTC for the storage product we discussed.
1188	Please review.
1188	There are a few areas in the doc.
1188	which I have highlighted for question.
1188	The business terms probably need to be flushed out a little more.
1188	I would be happy to discuss this with the appropriate individuals at your convenience.
1188	Sorry for the delay.
1189	Russell, I reviewed this with our business guys and they were fine with what you represent here.
1189	We did not check this with Tom Balcerowiz and he needs to take a look at it.
1189	Have your technical people gotten with Tom yet on any of these issues?
1189	If not then we can run it down on this end.
1189	Our only concern was that reliability between Gulf's 230 kv system and AEC's 115 kv system was not addressed.
1189	It was our understanding that this was a question of the PSC staff.
1189	Are there plans to provide any information concerning this item, or is no information available from AEC for such assessment?
1189	Any word concerning WFEC's response to our petition or any filings they have made with the PSC?
1190	Darren, Please prepare a credit ticket for Sierra Pacific Power Company.
1190	Per Russell Diamonds request, I am forwarding this to your attention.
1190	Let me know if you need anything else.
1191	Darren, Since the Master is an old vintage, we are amending to reflect the current version and specifically any credit revisions that are necessary.
1191	The old master was only set up for 6 month or less term deals with volumes of 15,000 MMBtu or less.
1192	Ken, I made a few tweaks.
1192	Attached are the revised docs.
1193	I'll will be around.
1193	Give me a call before you come up.
1194	Chris, Sorry for delay.
1194	We plan on making a decision a getting back with the candidates no later than April 6th.
1195	Barry, Attached is a draft of the confirm for the Sierra Deal.
1195	This confirm reflect only the volumes related to Package Two.
1195	The confirm for package one would be indentical to this one with term and volumes revised.
1195	As we discussed this confirm, does not reflect the revisions needed to the existing master.
1195	Please review and let's discuss.
1196	Debra, Darren Should be sending you two credit tickets for these entities.
1196	I will prepare the confirms for the Nevada Power Co. Master.
1196	Thanks.
1197	Barry, Attached are the Master Firm agreement for both Sierra Pacific and Nevada.
1197	If you are OK with these, we can foward to them for their review.
1197	As soon you provide any comments on the Transaction Agreement, I can finalize them under the Nevada Power master agreement.
1198	FYI.
1199	I will be attending.
1200	We can go ahead and prepare the termination letter, but it looks like Cheryl has some issues to flush out before we officialy terminate that tower lease.
1201	Barry, Attached are both confirms for the Nevada Power master with the changes we discussed yesterday.
1201	Please review and if acceptable, please forward Nevada Power.
1201	I am also re-attaching the Masters for both Sierra and Nevada.
1201	No changes were made to the masters.
1202	Have you guys received any information from Gulf Power concerning regular updates on the construction?
1202	Jeff indicated that Gulf would be willing to provide updates monthly.
1202	If we haven't heard from Gulf, we need to push them to provide this info.
1203	Please see the attached.
1203	John, I think the only other issue was inserting the reference to Paragraph 6 in both Paragraphs 8 and 9.
1203	Let me know if you have any questions.
1204	Per your notes.
1205	Barbara, The attached doc.

1216	I have reviewed the documents and they are standard tariff type service agreements.
1216	There are two items to which I would like to draw your attention.
1216	These deals look to have a 10 year term since they are being served from Transmission Service.
1216	1.
1216	If Customer terminate earlier, there would be a termination payment equal to the loss in salvage value of the facilities used to serve the Customer.
1216	Not sure what this value is, but might be significant, depending on what facilities CP&L would install to serve these plants.
1216	2.
1216	There is a minimum bill each month that Customer would have to pay, even if there was no usage of power by Customer.

1280	Mark, The following are my responses to Phillip's changes in our letter agreement: 1.
1280	1st Sentence of Second Paragraph - Strike of reference to Section 3.3 and reference to Appendix 1 - ENA's right to decrease confirmed volumes and Phillips' rights to release the gas are clearly set out in Section 3.3.
1280	The "Operations/Delivery Scheduling Procedures" only are the method by which this is effected.
1280	This change needs to be removed.
1280	2.
1280	1st Sentence of Second Paragraph - The remainder of the changes to the 1st Sentence except for the strike of Seller's Daily Deliverability are OK.
1280	Seller's Daily Deliverability needs to remain as this is the correct terminology under the Purchase Agreement.
1280	All we are doing here is effecting the provisions of the Purchase Agreement to which both parties have already agreed.
1280	3.
1280	The added sentence at the end of the second paragraph - This needs to be stricken.
1280	The Medicine Bow System is not ENA's and we do not want to create a firm purchase deal with this letter.
1280	4.
1280	1st Sentence of Third Paragraph - The add from "that quantity of Gas..... to.......... (the "Released Gas"" should be removed. The term Released Gas is defined under the Purchase Agreement and doesn't need to be defined in this letter. I am OK with ENA "hereby" agreeing to waive any and all rights it has to under Section 3.3 to recall the Gas. However, the term rights ENA "may" have needs to be stricken. ENA's position is that we have the right to recall the gas as long as it hasn't been released longer than 120 days. If you wish to discuss these comments or would like me to discuss these with Phillips, I would be happy to do so.
1281	Steve, I will be there.
1282	Stephanie, I would suggest modifying Section 9.4 as follows: 9.4 Addendum 1, attached to this Agreement, the bid procedures under which the transportation capacity hereunder was obtained, is hereby incorporated by reference as part of this Agreement, solely for informational purposes only.
1283	Chris, Attached is a draft of the letter agreement between ENAP and ENA and Enron South America.
1283	Please review and forward any comments you have.
1283	There is an existing Confid.
1283	Agreement with ENAP which runs through January 21, 2002.
1283	The letter I have attached piggybacks off of this existing CA.
1283	Does Enron South America have local counsel who can answer whether certain provisions in the Agreement, such as choice of Texas law, are valid under Chilean law?
1283	We need to verify this or Texas law may not be binding.
1283	Let me know if you want to discuss or have any questions.
1284	FYI Attached is the draft gas agreement I had forwarded to EES earlier.
1284	I did not receive a response.
1285	Attached is the assignment.
1286	Ann, Sorry for not getting back to you on this.
1286	I have some answers on the issues that were on my to do list.
1286	It might make the most sense for me to comment in response to your memo dated March 8, and forward to you.
1286	I know there were several items that you were checking with your people and I would note those.
1286	Let me know what you think.
1287	Clement, Please review AEC's additions and let me know what you think.
1288	Ann, Attached is the memo AEC forward with ENA's responses redline.

1390	Wanted to make sure you had the latest docs.
1390	I discussed with Barry and the MDDQ section was not changed since this version.
1391	The importance of all long term plans to build a comfortable life faded away into cloud of apathy and listfulness.
1391	No cares anymore.
1391	Just extract as much as possible from each experience never knowing where it might take you.
1391	Wow.
1391	Such thought before used to scare the hell out of you.
1391	But isn't it ironic to finally find out no matter how much you try to control each aspect of your existence, it could end up somewhere completely unforeseeable anyway.
1391	You have no control.
1391	No control.
1391	So why try to control it.
1391	Why not open yourself up to all those unknowns, those risks, those potential great failures.
1392	You didn't hit your face on the pavement at any point in the evening did you?
1392	In case you didn't know, Barbara and I are going to China with Eric.
1392	I will be leaving June 4 and returning June 16.

1423	Kim, Attached are the revised documents for Palo Alto.
1423	The documents are revised to reflect the deal term comments that the City forwarded.
1423	I changed the name of the document to Natural Gas Services Agreement to address their concerns about a non commodity agreement.
1423	I have also added language requiring a City Council resolution to for this document.
1423	Instead of a legal opinion, we would require the City Attorney to approve both the Natural Gas Services and Transaction Agreements.
1423	In included a redline of the services agreement from the prior version.
1423	The Transaction Agreement would not redline on MS word for some reason.
1423	I will request my assistant to redline it for you on Monday using comparewrite.
1423	If you need help prior to my return, please coordinate with Jeff Hodge.
1423	Please forward these documents to the City if you are okay with them.
1423	Thanks.
1424	Rae, Please redline the No4 against the original No3 on compare write and forward via email to Kim Ward.

1427	Shonnie, Attached are my comments per our discussion.
1428	Mark, Attached are rough drafts of the following documents for the noted projects: Bay Gas Storage 1.
1428	Draft CSA 2.
1428	Draft Lease Agreement 3.
1428	Draft O&M Agreement Oakhill 1.
1428	Draft CSA 2.
1428	Draft O&M Agreement for Hanover to provide maintenance.
1428	Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information available at this time.
1428	I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS.
1428	If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be used.
1428	If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would need to be modified for the purchase option.
1428	My suggestion is to provide these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.
1428	But this gives them the basic idea.
1428	In my absence please contact Barbara for coordination of legal support in the event you cannot wait until I return.
1428	Thanks.
1429	Mark, I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement.
1429	I makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as this is really independent of the compression services.
1429	These storage company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use the counterparties paper.
1430	Attached is the executable form of the letter agreement.
1430	I have accepted all of Jerry's changes.
1430	Please print out two executables of the letter and execute and forward to Mark Whitt for execution by ENA.
1430	If you have any questions please contact me at (713) 853-3512.
1431	Stephanie, I made a few changes.
1431	Please review.
1432	Hey Guys!
1432	I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.
1432	A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.
1432	So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.
1432	The sights were pretty amazing.
1432	Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc. Definitely culture shock though.
1432	I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.
1432	I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.
1432	I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.
1432	The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.
1432	I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.
1432	Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!
1432	I heard about it the first week in China.
1432	Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.
1432	Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.
1432	There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.
1432	Doooh!!
1432	Other than that everything is going fine.
1432	Doing the old dating thing!
1432	Boy is that a ton of laughs.
1432	Women at this age are definitely interesting.
1432	I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, "Where is this relationship headed?"
1432	Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!
1432	Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.
1432	I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.
1432	Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?
1432	Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.
1432	Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.
1432	Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?
1432	10 more years and you can retire eh!
1432	Ernie, Sounds like things are going well at work.
1432	Congrats on the promo.
1432	We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.
1432	You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!
1432	The Buick sounds prime.
1432	240HP ought to take care of it.
1432	Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.
1432	What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?
1432	I still love to tell stories about that car.
1432	You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.
1432	Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.
1432	Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.
1432	Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.
1432	It is great to hear from you guys.
1432	We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.
1432	It has been to damn long.
1432	Take care and be safe, Bruddas.
1432	Gerald
1433	Re-sending.
1433	Didn't go through the first time.
1434	Resending, Didn't go through the first time.
1435	Hi Pat, Fortunately I was out of the country when all the flooding occurred and my house sustained no damage.
1435	Just spent two weeks in China and the sights were pretty amazing.
1435	How are things in Austin?
1436	Hey Ernie, Have you been able to send email to Bieraugel?
1436	I replied to the email address he sent, but I keep receiving undeliverable messages.
1437	Darren, I will be meeting with Sandi in the morning to get a download.
1437	I will get with you after that to assess where we need to go.
1437	Thanks.
1438	Nelson, Attached is the Confirm and GTC for the deal with Devon.
1438	Please review and if acceptable you can forward to Devon for review.
1439	Kay, Please see the attached.
1440	We flew into Shanghai and explored for 2 days.
1440	Next we went to Qingdao for 3 days and finally spent 5 days in Beijing.
1440	I would have to say that Beijing was the highlight of the trip.

1507	Please review and lets discuss asap.
1508	Susanne, What is the status of the professional services agreement?
1509	Staci, Attached is the final form of affidavit.
1509	We plan on emailing this version to WFEC's lawyer for review prior to execution.
1509	Given the confidentiality provision in our CSA, could you please respond via email with FGT's approval of this disclosure.
1509	Thanks.
1510	Per my voicemail, attached is the master spot contract.
1510	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1511	Susanne, Attached is a redlined agreement with the revision to Section 8.3 we discussed.
1511	If acceptable, I will prepare two executables for routing.
1511	Thanks for your help.
1512	Attached is the revised CA per my discussion with their attorney.
1512	Please review and forward to Anadarko.
1513	Two things; 1.
1513	The modification excludes all oral information.
1513	So any confidential information that you guys orally give them is not protected.
1513	2.
1513	It might be a headache for you guys to remember to mark everything as confidential.
1513	If you forget, it is not protected.
1513	I think the changes should come out.
1514	Mary, Can you prepare two separate CAs between Rusk County Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Enron Compression Services Company.
1514	You can use the bilateral form we normally use.
1514	Rusk's information is Rusk County Electric Cooperative, Inc. Henderson, Texas 75653-1169 The scope for the two CAs is as follows: 1.
1514	"discussions concerning a potential electric compression project at OGS Pipeline, L.L.C.'s Hinkle Compressor Station" 2.
1514	"discussions concerning a potential electric compression project at Anadarko Energy Services Company's Carthage Facility" Let me know if you have any questions.

1516	Sorry about that.
1517	The drafts per our discussion.
1518	Yes, This looks to be a separate deal and mine was only a spot deal.
1519	Based on our discussions yesterday, attached are the BHP Confirm and GTC.
1519	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
1519	We still need to input the Delivery Point information.
1520	Bill, The contract itself does not have a confidentiality clause, but per Jeff Stone's email, Gulf does consider the contract proprietary information and does not want this info voluntarily disclosed at this time.
1520	I forwarded the email to you earlier.
1520	Concerning the emails etc., as I mentioned before, ECS has a copy of a Confidentiality Agreement that we executed by Gulf, initialed by me as ECS attorney, but not signed by an officer of ECS.
1520	Our business guys think we executed this agreement.
1520	This CA would cover all information exchanged between Gulf and ECS.
1520	I have asked Russell Badder's to check with Gulf to obtain an executed copy.
1520	Nothing in the CA agreements prohibit me from disclosing the CA.
1520	So we could potentially provide the copy of the CA we have to John.
1520	Obviously the correspondence between ECS and Gulf contains the commerical terms of our power deal as we negotiated with Gulf.
1520	Given Jeff's email and the CA copy I have in hand, I would not want to disclose the emails and memo's without Gulf's explicit permission.
1520	Let me know if you have any ideas on the best way to approach this with WFLA.
1521	Chris, I am fine with his revision if you are OK with the terms.
1522	Stacy, Susan called and asked that I prepare an assignment letter.
1522	I will do so.
1522	Could you send me a copy of the contract we are assigning and a copy of the assignment in interest letter.
1522	Thanks.
1523	Ellen, Let's talk about this before you send out.
1524	Sandi, The following are the contracts that were inadvertantly assigned to AEP in the sale as we discussed.
1524	Centana Intrastate Pipeline Co. #96019236 Gas Transmission TECO, Inc. #96041723 Gas Transmission TECO, Inc. #96041724 Let me know your thoughts on the best way to proceed to return these deals to ENA.
1524	Thanks.
1524	Miss me?
1524	Gerald
1525	I already made that mistake once.
1526	Larry, The letter looks fine to me.
1527	Raimund, Attached is a form of amendment for both the Athens and Hartwell Precedent Agreement.
1527	The amendment modifies the termination date as we discussed.
1527	Two pieces of info that I left blank are the new date to be inserted and the date of execution of the original precedent agreements.
1527	I do not have a copy of the dated executed PAs.
1527	I do have a copy of the guaranties.
1527	I will forward a copy to you.
1527	Let me know if you have any questions.
1528	Mary, Can you please prepare executables of the attached document.
1528	There are some redlined changes, all of which I am OK with.
1528	Let me know if you have any questions.
1528	Thanks.
1529	The product description was to be used for various pipelines (e.g. NGPL, Transco, etc.).
1529	Yes, in this product ENA would always be the seller or the buyer of the capacity to be released.
1529	I visited with Steve earlier, and the concept that Julie Gomez had discussed earlier was allowing third party pipelines or third parties to use EOL to buy and sell capacity from or to other third parties.
1529	As far as I know, these were just discussions and the only EOL product implemented was the one I forwarded to you.
1530	This deal was done some time ago.
1530	I assume that all ENA Upstream deal makers going forward know they should be going through you.
1531	Wasn't sure if you were copied on all this.
1532	Please see attached.
1532	Thanks.
1533	Attached is the CA for the project we discussed with NNG.
1533	Let me know when you want executable agreements.

1535	Might be too late, but attached are the letters with my revisions.
1535	Let me know if you still need me to initial.
1536	I am fine with this term sheet.
1537	Attached is a draft of the McCook agreement.

1538	Mark, Could you please review the attached.
1538	The documents are for access to a commodities and derivative products online exchange.
1538	ENA Upstream Company, LLC is the Enron entity needing access.
1538	The last directive I received it that all these types of documents for trading platforms needed to be reviewed by you.
1538	Let me know if I am mistaken.
1538	Thanks.
1539	Revised per your voicemail.
1540	Judy, Attached is the form of Master Firm Agreement for ENA and ENA Upstream.
1540	Could you please fill in the Notice Info for ENA Upstream.
1540	Thought it would probably be the same as ENA, but didn't want to assume that.
1540	Once you return to me, I will prepare two executables for signature.
1540	Thanks.
1541	I am fowarding the originals to you.
1541	Please obtain execution for ENA Upstream and ENA and return them both to me.
1541	Thanks.
1542	Thanks for the quick turnaround on that.
1542	Any word on when we can expect this to be set for hearing?
1543	Attached is the revised draft based on Stephanie's comments.
1543	Please review.
1544	See my attached comments.
1545	Mary, Please forward me, via email, the two Rusk County Electric Cooperative Agreements you previously prepared for me.

1584	Let me know if you have any questions.
1585	Sorry to bug you, but I have one more.
1586	We might want to forward this email version for their review first.
1586	I would think that their attorney's might have a few comments.
1587	Joan, Attached is the agency agreement form.
1587	The form still refers to TBI Field Services.
1587	This should be revised to reflect the current owner of the system.
1587	Can you provide that info.
1588	It is still on Chris Hilgert's desk.
1588	I will bug him to get it back to you.
1588	Sorry for the delay.
1589	Paul, Attached is the revised letter Agreement for Greeley.
1589	Please review and if you are OK with it, please forward to Greeley.
1589	They had asked that we drop the contract number references in the first paragraph, but we need to have some way of identifying the contracts under which we are acting as agent, so l kept them in the document.
1589	Let me know if you have any questions.
1590	That sounds good.
1590	Schedule it up with Majed.
1591	Please use the attached GTC is place of the previously forwarded for all deals going forward.
1592	Not anytime soon, but within the next couple of weeks.
1593	Alan, With respect to the Transactions for Cheyenne and Public Service Company, Enron prefers to use the Firm General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement for these deals.
1593	These two transactions are 3 month firm deals.
1593	The GISB is not set up for firm transactions longer than 1 month in term.
1593	There is no termination payment provision in a GISB and Enron requires this language for any firm deal.
1593	Enron's general policy is not to use the GISB for any firm deal that is longer than 1 month.
1593	I would be happy to discuss this further at your convenience.
1593	I can be reached at (713) 853-3512.
1594	The only change is in Section 2.
1594	I refer to the requirement to schedule the Daily Contract Quantity instead the Nomination.
1595	Yea, Things have changed quite a bit.
1595	Life as usual at Enron.
1596	Randy, For your information, I am forwarding you a summary of my review of the Bridgeline documents concerning the Texaco Sorrento cavern issues This summary was prepared on behalf of Enron.
1597	Keegan, I think the attached is a Word Perfect File.
1597	Can you try to convert this file to an MSWord file.
1597	Thanks.
1598	I have a conflict and will not be able to attend.
1598	Let me know if there is any thing you need my help on.
1599	Keith, The attached document was blank.
1599	Could you resend the document?
1600	That sounds good.

1601	Paul, Attached is a redlined version of the agreement with the changes we discussed.
1601	Please review and forward to Greeley for their review.
1602	Attached is the draft that was provided to WFEC's counsel.
1602	As I stated they have requested to depose ECS as well.
1603	I think your on solid ground.
1603	I think the stock will stay down for a little while until they name those that will join Lay in the office of the chairman.
1603	We continue to beat earnings estimates, but things like broadband, Dahbol, and now Skilling put pressure on the stock.
1603	Not much new going on.
1603	Just hanging out.
1603	Working.
1603	Will be heading to Austin for the game on Sept 1.
1603	Let's see if the horns can live up to all the hype.
1603	I have a pair of season tix for all the home games, so I will let you know when I have an extra for the game.
1603	See if you can't get a hall pass from your better half.
1604	Keith, Attached is the revised PSA for the Napoleonville warehouse.
1604	I removed the mineral rights reservations and added in the sales price.

1605	Attached is a draft of the mowing letter for Assumption Parish.
1605	Please review.
1605	The address needs to be added in Exhibit A. Let me know if you have any questions.
1606	David Marshall (risk management, insurance group) will be the one to set the limits.
1606	I usually send a copy of the agreement and ask for his comments.
1606	I can handle once we get a draft of the agreement.

1607	Please review, specifically Section 4.2 and Article 7.
1607	I want to make sure you are OK with those sections specifically.
1607	Sorry for the delay on this.
1608	Jean, I have reviewed Marathon's revisions to the CA.
1608	I agree that these changes are minor and I am OK with all of them except one.
1608	With respect to the stricken sentence in Paragraph 7, I would ask Marathon the reason for the strike.
1608	I think the sentence only reinforces the right to compete concept in the first sentence and further specify's the concept.
1608	I would be happy to discuss this further with Marathon.
1608	Thanks.
1609	Shane, Can you send me the highlighted document that you forwarded for their review.
1609	I need to see the revision to understand their issue.
1610	Please see attached.
1610	Thanks in advance.
1611	Attached is a draft of the CA.
1611	Please review.
1611	I need the full legal name of Illinois Power.
1612	There is a Treebeard's in the tunnel at 1100 Lousiana.
1612	There isn't too much towards Enron.
1612	I don't mind going towards your building.
1612	You have probably been to Bucco di Bacco (sp?) over by your building.
1612	Good Italian.
1612	There is also a Cafe Express down there.
1612	I am OK with any of those.
1612	Do you like Sushi?
1612	There is a Miyako in the Bank One Center.
1613	Let's discuss when you get a chance.

1615	Let me know.
1616	Needs the facts filled in.
1617	It was great talking with you at lunch.
1617	I have never known a real life tap dancer before.
1617	I feel honored.
1617	I am outta here tomorrow, so have a great weekend.
1618	Made a few slight revisions.
1619	No problem.
1619	Let it go.
1620	The entity should be LRCI, Inc. You can change the entity in the letter and send it out.
1620	Let me know if you have any questions.
1621	Jean, Based on Richard's reply, I am OK with the strike.
1621	I just wanted to make it clear that ENA does compete with Marathon is these areas, but ENA would certainly only use the Confidential Information for the purposes of the proposed Transactions.
1621	Do you want me to prepare executables?
1622	Mary, Can you check to see if Jempy can sign for LRCI, Inc. and let Rakhi Israni know?
1622	In the alternative, please provide her a copy of the corporate data sheet which list the VPs who can execute documents for LRCI.
1623	Chris, I need the project scopes as well.
1623	Can you give me brief descriptions?
1624	Keegan, Please print out two originals of the attached CA for execution on ENA letterhead.
1624	I will need to initial.
1624	Thanks
1625	Few comments.
1626	I don't know the status of the Crawfish documents.
1626	I will have to check.
1626	Steve Van Hooser was handling those documents.
1626	With respect to your previous question, the PSA for the Napoleonville warehouse went to the Assumption Parish last week.
1627	Hey Jennifer, How is it going?
1627	Did you survive your long run this weekend?
1627	It has been pretty crazy here since I got back.
1627	I really need to start focusing more on the guitar so I can become rich and famous and not have to deal with all this.
1627	I am so tired.
1628	The sections are 18 CFR Part 161.
1628	Specifically Section 161.1, 161.2, and 161.3.
1629	Alan, Per our discussion, attached are drafts of Enron's Master Firm agreements.
1629	Sorry for the delay.
1629	Enron's preference would be to use these master instead of the GISB agreements for the firm deals.
1629	The Firm GTC were really meant as a stop gap until we could be these Masters in place.
1629	I did review the GISB we currently have in place with Northern States Power (WI and MN).
1629	These agreements do not have the necessary credit provisions and termination payment provisions required for firm deals that are included in our attached Master.
1629	These Masters should address the specific concerns included in your email.
1629	1.
1629	The Masters contains provisions to deal wth the possibility that a price will not published on any day in the same manner as the GISB does.
1629	2.
1629	The netting issue we need to address.
1629	The GISB don't have netting provisions, but we don't use GISB for any firm deals over 1 month in term.
1629	I am not sure I understand the regulatory issues with respect to netting.
1629	These Master contain netting provisions.
1629	Let's discuss once you have reviewed the Masters.
1629	3.
1629	Force Majeure provisions are similar to the GTC.
1629	Enron prefers a vary narrow definition of FM.
1629	We modify the GISB FM to reflect this with special provisions.
1629	If you could provide specific comments we can address your issues.
1629	4.
1629	Audit provisions are included in the Masters.
1629	5.
1629	Any affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions can be address in this Master.
1629	If you could provide specific language we can address this issue.
1629	Putting these Master in place would really make business going forward much more efficient.
1629	Please review and let's discuss and your earliest convenience.
1629	I can be reached at (713) 853-3512.
1630	Attached is the revised Committed Reserves Confirm with the language we discussed.
1630	Please modify the confirm templates for the Sept. wellhead deals (and those remaining from August) to reflect the revision.
1630	Let me know if you have any questions.
1631	Janette, To be more complete, the MS Word program Barbara and I were referring to on voicemail removes the Meta Data from the document.
1632	Keegan, Can you print the attached doc.
1632	on Enron Logo Only letterhead.
1632	This version had redlines, so you will need to accept the changes before printing.
1633	Attached is a draft for your review.
1633	Note that, Prior to giving any information received from Anadarko to CSI, we would need to get Anadarko's written permission.
1634	Please review the attached.
1635	They won't leave.
1636	Shane, As we discussed, we can remove the strike of 3.2(b) in the Tennessee TPAs.
1636	I put in a call to Mojave to discuss this issue with them.
1636	After my conversation with them we can decide how to proceed.
1636	All other TPAs should be sent out with our typical language.
1637	You can save it in my Confidentiality Agreements folder.
1638	I added Section 5 - Non-Compete.
1639	Attached is the agreement with my revisions.
1640	Sorry about the delay.
1640	I have just been covered up.
1640	Here it is.
1641	Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Enfolio Master for the Ocean transaction.
1641	The redline reflects the changes from the original draft.
1641	Also attached is a clean version of the Transaction Agreement.
1641	Please review and if acceptable, please forward to Ocean for their review.
1642	Jeff, Attached is the redline from your earlier revisions.
1643	Jeff, Shane Lakho is currently preparing several TPA for Enron Energy Services and another EES entity.
1643	I know that portions of EES are rolling into wholesale.
1643	Should we be initialing for EES?
1643	The agreements are Enron's standard TPA form so there shouldn't be any issues.
1644	Russell, The data you requested last week concerning the motor is as follows: 1.
1644	Full Load MVA rating: 11.4 for each unit 2.
1644	Across the line starting MVA: 43.8 for each unit
1645	Hey Walter, Thanks for stopping and leaving the note.
1645	I'm glad I got to know you at the happy hours.
1645	We will have to schedule another Gallant Knight evening sometime soon.
1645	Good luck to you as well.
1645	Take care.
1646	I was in Austin for most of the weekend.
1646	A friend of mine was supposed to have a boat party on Lake Travis Friday night, but that was cancelled due to the rain.
1646	We just went out on 4th Street instead.
1646	Went to the game Sat.
1646	night.
1646	We won so that was good.
1646	How was the girls road trip?
1647	I am fine with the change.
1647	Mary, please prepare executables and make the change in the NUI document as well.
1648	GT, I will have an extra ticket for the game this weekend.
1648	My friend who was going to go back out.
1648	It is yours if you want to use it.
1648	Let me know.
1649	The contracts for the notice letters.
1650	Sounds like I need to take gambling lessons from you.
1650	I consistently lose money when I gamble.
1650	Do you have Tristan's email address?
1650	Wanted to see if we could hook up in Austin for some Longhorn celebration.
1651	FYI
1652	Rudwell, Attached is the guaranty with my comments redlined.
1652	Please review and forward.
1652	If you have any questions, please call me at x-33512.
1653	Attached is the Burlington guaranty with my comments.
1653	I was unable to redline the doc.
1653	Computer problems.
1653	I am forwarding the clean version.
1653	Hopefully Burlington can redline against the draft they sent.
1654	Ned, I am fine with all of their changes.
1654	Attached is a clean version reflects their changes.
1654	Ask them to print out two copies and execute.
1655	Frank, Attached for your review is a draft of the settlement agreement we discussed.
1656	Attached is the letter.
1656	The address information and Unocal's full name need to be inserted and then print two copies on ENA letterhead for execution.
1657	I have reviewed the term sheet and I am fine with the form.
1657	I did spot a potential issue with the Transport piece of the proposal.
1657	If ENA holds transport on NNG, it cannot simply sell use of that capacity to Unocal.
1657	The shipper of record with NNG needs to hold title to the gas that is being transported.
1657	For Unocal to utilize this capacity, they would need to either directly contract with NNG for such capacity, or ENA would acquire the capacity then "Capacity Release" the capacity to Unocal.
1657	The Capacity Release would be subject to NNG bulletin board posting requirements.
1657	Let me know if you want to discuss further.
1658	Frank, Attached is the letter with the revised Section 2.
1658	I also added some language to the beginning of Section 5 to make it clear how that Section operates with Section 2.
1659	David, Attached is the document with the insurance mark-ups that I noted on my voice mail.
1659	Please review and lets discuss.
1660	Frank, I made a few tweaks.
1660	Please review.
1661	Gary, Can you give me a scope of the issues we need to address in this CA.
1661	Thanks.
1662	Attached is the some of amendment info we discussed last week.
1662	Looks like they want to get this out this week.
1663	It will be in 38C1 beginning at 11 am CT tommorrow.
1664	Kay, Please see the attached.
1665	Per Gary Bryan's request, attached is a Confidentiality Agreement form for your review.
1666	Mary, Can you prepare CA for the following entities.
1666	Black Diamond should be bi-lateral and Shell needs to be unilateral (i.e. only protects us).
1666	Let me know if you have any questions.
1667	Shane, After reviewing the Mojave TPA, I contacted Carlos Pena with El Paso to discuss.
1667	He agreed that Section 3.2(B) can be stricken.
1667	He also agreed that the Sentence In Section & on Page 10 which reads "Text from here to the end of item 7 has been inserted by Enron North America Corp."
1667	is a note which should be stricken.
1667	Also for consistency sake, Section 3.2(B) in the main body of the agreement should not be stricken.
1667	Exhibit A overrides this Section so the strike is not necessary in the main body of the Agreement.
1667	Lastly, the full legal name "Enron North America Corp."
1667	should be inserted in the agreement.
1667	Let me know if you have any questions.
1668	Attached is the form of GTC Wellhead for use in the Torch Energy transaction.
1669	Rakhi, Attached is the letter with my revisions.
1669	I would have Mr. Neyman sign the letter.
1669	Let me know if you have any questions.
1670	Our insurance contact is David Marshall.
1670	His phone number is 713 853-6847.
1671	Judy, I added the language for the payment by wire transfer in Section 6.
1672	Attached is your proposed language with my comments redlined.
1672	Please review.
1672	I would be happy to discuss.
1672	I can be reached at (713) 853-3512.
1673	FYI, We have one more outstanding issue.
1673	I have given them our insurance expert (David Marshall) name so they can discuss their insurance comments directly.
1674	Phil, Can you send Tyrell the schedule that is to be attached as Appendix A?
1675	Attached are the revisions I sent to John.
1676	Debra, Could you resend to Enfolio Spot Master to Mark?
1676	Let me know if you have any questions.
1677	Attached is the revised Keep Whole Language.
1677	I assume this language would completely replace the Variance langauge that we currently insert in our GTCs and any Replacement Price Differential Language in our Pooling Point and Wellhead GTCs.
1677	I.e.
1677	this will be the only measure of damages for these deals.
1677	If this is not correct, let's discuss.
1677	Ellen, This language would be the same language use for the W&T Offshore and Spinaker deals.
1677	Is this correct Nelson?
1677	Please review before sending out to make sure I have correctly captured your business deal.
1678	Attached are the Cascade Documents redlined with my changes.
1678	Please review and let's discuss further before forward by to Cascade.
1678	Some items to note: 1.
1678	As we discussed before, the non-compete provision must be approved through the proper channels at Enron.
1678	The current Enron Corp. policy requires approvals by: 1.
1678	The President (or equivalent) of Enron North America Corp. 2.
1678	General Counsel of ENA (Mark Haedicke) 3.
1678	Executive VP, Corp. Development of Enron Corp. 4.
1678	Anyone else that ENA requires to approve these non-compete agreements.
1678	2.
1678	We need to scrub how this will fit with EES' business in this area.
1678	I tried to narrow the non-compete provisions as much as possible.
1678	Let's discuss.
1679	Hi Mom, I am doing fine.
1679	Sorry I haven't responded earlier.
1679	Glad to hear that ya'll are back safe and sound.
1679	I am staying busy with the usual stuff.
1679	Talked to Sharon last week.
1679	It sounds like she is getting really close to the time.
1679	Another grandchild.
1679	Are ya'll going up to Dallas shortly after the birth?
1680	Rusty, Per Nick's request, attached is the form of professional services agreement we have used for Enron North America.
1681	Max, Please see attached redline from Colorado Springs.
1681	They revised the Collateral limits in Section 4.5.
1681	Let me know your thoughts.
1682	My username is P00502719 and password is 14369477.
1683	I will put in on my calendar.
1684	Andy, I have a few comments.
1684	Attached is a redline.
1685	Attached is the term sheet with my revisions.
1685	Please review.
1686	Hey GT, When are you coming to H-town?
1687	Attached for review are the draft template GTC and Confirm forms for the monthly wellhead and pooling point purchase business of ENA Upstream.
1687	Please review and provide any comments you may have as soon as possible.
1687	We would like to implement these templates for October business going forward.
1687	Judy, We need to discuss how the "Keep Whole" language used for the torch deal, should be incorporated into these forms for those deals with the negotiated Keep Whole.
1687	Ellen, has scheduled a meeting for Thursday to discuss.
1688	It was very nice running into you also.
1688	Banker, smanker.
1688	G works hard for the money, so you had better treat him right.
1688	What do you have going on this week?
1688	Thurs.
1688	or Fri.
1688	after work would work.
1688	(That sounds weird)
1689	Attached is the precedent agreement with changes redlined.
1689	I scanned their hardcopy.
1689	I added that same outs that were included in the Momentum agreements, but I left the dates blank.
1689	Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
1690	Let's discuss on Thursday.
1691	Attached is the form of amendment to guaranty for Tractebel.
1691	Do you know the $$ limits for signing authority for Bridgeline.
1691	I.e.
1691	when do the management member have to sign a guaranty as opposed to Randy Curry?
1692	FYI
1693	I actually found a copy yesterday and forwarded to Keith for him to review.
1693	I think we either want a cashier check or a wire transfer.
1693	Do we have a legal description for these tracts to use in the sale documents?
1693	We will need to have one to finalize the documents.
1694	John, The meeting is tomorrow at 2:00 in 30C2
1695	Max, The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.
1695	A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.
1695	To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.
1695	We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.
1695	The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.
1695	This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.
1695	I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.
1695	We probably need to get on a conference call with them.
1695	I am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.
1695	Tyrell, do you want to set something up a call with Marcus and his attorney to discuss these issues?
1696	Thanks for your help on this!
1697	I am fine with this form.
1698	After this hearing staff makes a recommendation to the commission.
1698	The commission decision should be issued in late Oct. or early Nov.
1699	Ned, Attached is the revised CSI CA based on our discussion.
1699	The non-compete provision is removed.
1699	As we discussed they would still be obligated to not use our Confidential Information for any purpose other than to evaluate a transaction with ECS.
1699	However, they could still pitch a proposal not utilize our Confidential Information.
1700	Rude Dog, How is it going?
1700	Enjoying every moment of marital bliss!!
1700	Must be weird to be a student again and have to do all that studying and drink all that beer.
1700	The Horns are looking pretty good.
1700	The defense has really been spectacular as well as special teams.
1700	The offense is sputtering right now, but I think they will get back on track.
1700	I am going to the UH game this weekend.
1700	We had better put a whipping on them.
1700	But with Texas you never know.
1700	Gone to any Michigan games yet?
1701	Judy, Attached are the Torch Docs redlined with my changes.
1701	I also changed some the the title on Exhibit A.
1702	Max, Tyrell is attempting to set up a conference call with these guys for Monday afternoon.
1702	He will get back to us with the details.
1703	Rude-Dog, Enron is still treating me like a baby treats a diaper!
1703	Just kidding.
1703	Things are going fairly well and have gotten pretty busy within the last couple of weeks.
1703	Still trying to recharge the girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.
1703	Kinda of in a dry spell right now.
1703	Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.
1703	Glad to hear things are going well for you.
1703	Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4 hours a day are over.
1703	I am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.
1703	Maurice Gordon, even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc.
1703	He crushed Curry in the endzone for the safety.
1703	Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows Gordon more room to work.
1703	He is very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.
1703	Mark my words, Derrick Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!
1703	Watching him against NC was a joy.
1703	He toys with the lineman and makes them look silly when he jukes and blows past them.
1703	The guy needs to be starting now.
1703	I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.
1703	The game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.
1703	You should be able to catch it.
1703	Watch #11 on Defense.
1703	Look for me in the stands.
1703	I be the one wearing burnt orange.
1704	Attached are the revised redlined docs.
1704	per our discussion.

1705	Kyle, Attached is the agreement with the two changes I discussed on my voice mail message.
1705	Please review.
1705	Do we have a property description and a plat?
1706	Sometimes you just have to step up to the big leagues.
1706	I actually didn't know how much that trash can costs.
1706	The ex bought it.
1706	It is stainless steel, not chrome.
1706	I will sell you mine for $90.
1706	I will even Lysol it for you.
1706	Congrats on your oversized chair with ottoman.
1707	XX-Large.
1707	Thanks.
1708	Sorry, Jean Mrha's assistant should have it.

1713	Harry, We have been using Bill Bryant and the Katz Kutter law firm to represent ECS' interest in the territorial dispute between Gulf Power and WFEC.
1713	I forwarded your email to him and asked for his input.
1713	Attached is his input.
1713	I think his suggestion about a meeting with all parties involved is a good one.
1713	Let me know what you think.
1714	Chris, Attached is Shonnie's draft of the Closing Statement.
1714	Note that she nets out the amount with the payment due under the amended Master Services Agreement.
1714	Please review.
1715	Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina.
1715	As we discussed Chris, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.
1715	Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes will need to be cancelled.
1715	Nora, can locate these originals.
1715	I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.

1715	Need to verify.
1716	For your review.
1716	Let's talk early Monday.
1717	Larry, What is the status of this permit?
1718	Frank, Sandi Braband had approved those agreements.
1718	I know that the El Paso pipelines are very strict on any changes to the GISB form.
1718	I did discuss removal of Section 3.2(b) for Mojave pipeline (an El Paso pipeline) and their attorney agreed.
1718	Unfortunately he only handles the EP Pipelines in the west.
1718	Might be worth another run at their legal to see if we can modify the GISB to meet our template.
1718	Let me know if I can help.
1719	FYI
1720	I responded to Frank about 20 minutes ago.
1721	Attached is the revised statement.
1721	Please review.
1721	I will have ENA execute as soon as I hear from NBP.
1722	Mark and Dave, Please print out two copies of each and execute all four.

1727	Lisa, I made significant revisions to this form.

1728	Lisa, Your changes look fine to me.
1728	I added the sentence to make it clear that ECS would not be owning and operating that portion of the equipment.
1728	It wasn't clear to me from the section which indicate we will be arranging for the installation of the compressors.
1729	Keith, Please draft the letter and forward for my review.
1729	Could you also forward the language for Item #1as you revised it?
1729	Thanks.
1730	Attached is the revised doc per our discussions.
1731	Don't you have work to do today?

1739	Everything is going fine!
1739	How are the law school plans going?
1740	Mark, Attached for your review is a draft of the Capacity Release agreement we discussed.
1741	The only way would be to copyright the material.
1741	Any original writing can be copyrighted.
1741	At a minimum, I would mark any submission as Copyrighted material.
1741	I don't know the specific requirements for filing.
1741	You might want to do some net research on the subject.
1741	I would think the Fed.
1741	Government would have a web site on how to copyright material.
1741	Hope this helps.
1742	I did prepare these.
1743	Here, Here, I would like to second Ernie's sentiments.
1743	We are very proud of you guys and hope that you stay safe.
1743	Drop us a note if you can.
1744	Ernie, I think that's right.
1744	It makes sense since he is Chief Weapons Officer.
1744	Bieraugel is one smart dude.
1744	He helped me through many an engineering class.
1744	Wouldn't be surprised to see Admiral Bieraugel one day.
1744	Did you see on CNN how the Navy guys are writing "For NYPD" and "FDNY" on the bombs being dropped in Afghan!
1744	Eat that!!
1744	Yep, Saturday was pretty depressing.
1744	I have to hand it to OU.
1744	Stoops is an outstanding coach.
1744	I will still go to the games, though some of the luster is lost.
1744	How is the family doing?

1744	William Boone.

1756	I will be out Thurs.
1756	and Fri.
1756	but will check voicemail.
1757	Nelson, I reviewed the form provided.
1757	Some comments 1.
1757	Generally we should make every attempt to get these guys to use our paper.
1757	From an ENA Upstream overall standpoint, if we start using other forms then we lose consistency with how these deals are administered (payment, noms., etc).
1757	2.
1757	With respect to this form there are some conceptual issues.
1757	A. No specific measures of damages if the parties breach B. No detail on the type of gas being purchase (i.e. Wellhead, Pooling Point, firm, interruptible) Contract states that "Seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to purchase".
1757	We would have to tie this down.
1757	C. Nomination deadlines and notification for production variances is not addressed.
1757	3.
1757	There are also some legal issues; State Law, Arbitration, etc., Indemnity In summary, we would have to make significant revisions to this form and it would end up looking much more like our form.
1757	I don't know the dynamics of the relationship.
1757	Are they insistent on using their paper?
1758	Mark, Attached are the latest.
1758	I smoothed out some of your changes and added a section in the TA to address assignment of the gathering agreement.
1758	Please review.
1759	Attached are the latest based on our discussions.
1759	I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.
1759	I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.
1759	This could add to the Transaction Agreement.
1760	FYI
1761	Brian, Attached are drafts of the following docs.: 1.

1775	I added the language we discussed on the phone.

1789	Specifically they are: 1.
1789	I am OK with including reasonable attorney fees, but they must be included in the $2.5 million dollar cap.
1789	2.
1789	The use of subtantially in Paragraph 2 seems redundant.
1789	The notice requires reasonable detail.
1789	To add subtantial compliance on top of that is redundant.

1829	Concerning the earlier question.
1829	It is not clear under Texas law whether the surface rights by themselves are sufficient to convery the right to use property for gas storage.
1829	Thus the rights should be leased from both the surface owner and the mineral owner to be sure.

1832	They were required to use "all reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents".
1832	To the extent they did not do so, ENA should not be liable for the $25,000 per month.
1832	I assume Hugh Connett at Bridgeline is the proper person contact person at Bridgeline.

1842	I am OK with the wiring instructions.
1843	I agree with your summary.
1844	Brandi, Attached is the Confidentiality Agreement for Torch.
1844	Let me know if you have any questions.
1845	I am OK with the matrix.
1845	Please also note that any GTC with a term of 9 months or longer should be signed by Enron and Counterparties.
1845	Nelson, are you OK with using a GTC Spot for one-day deals?
1846	Clement, Attached is the form of guaranty we discussed.
1846	Let me know if you have any questions.
1847	Ken, Attached is the form of guaranty from Enron Corp. This guaranty is currently be routed for approval.
1848	Ken, Below is the revised language for the restriction on activities paragraph in the Cash Sale Form The Property is restricted in that no activity using explosives or other high-power detonating devices may be conducted on the Property within 500 feet of the storage well facility of Vendor located near the Property that would fracture or cause subsurface movement to the storage well facility of Vendor.

1852	Chris, Attached is the document to which Russell and I have agreed.
1852	Next step is for us to get signed and fax to Russell.
1852	Do you have the tract descriptions that Gulf forwarded?
1852	Does Dave?

1853	2.
1853	Draft of the Board Resolution you added to the Act of Sale.

1854	FYI, The latest.
1855	Chris, The letter was signed and faxed to Gulf at approximately 5 pm today.
1856	Lisa, My only comments would be in the Firm Transport section.
1856	Since ENA can not directly provide firm transport on NNG, I would rephrase it as "ENA would arrange for Firm Transport on NNG".
1856	As we discussed before, Unocal would need to enter directly into the FT with NNG or ENA would have to contract for the FT and then release it to Unocal pursuant to the capacity release procedures (which would include posting and bidding requirements).
1857	Attached is the revised guaranty form.
1857	Let me know if you need anything else for execution.
1858	Attached is a redline of the Act of Sale with my comments.

1860	Ken, Per our discussion attached are the drafts of revised Act (redlined with my comments) and the Board Resolution for your review.
1861	See attached.
1861	I took a guess at the payment timing and our involvement in the construction process.
1861	Do we want to let Jim, review that section also?
1861	I am trying to leave the office by 12 tomorrow.
1861	Any comments ASAP would be appreciated.
1861	Upon receipt of comments, I will forward to Bill Howell.
1862	Eric, The answers to your questions based on the information I have are: 1.
1862	The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
1862	2.
1862	All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. 3.
1862	I don't know.
1862	I don't think that any of the licenses were new after the transaction date.
1862	Robert, any different info?
1862	4.
1862	To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.
1862	Do you agree, Robert?
1862	To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. They were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's 40% equity stake and 50% control.
1862	No transfer applications for these licenses has been filed.
1862	Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).
1862	LRP was merged into Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America Corp.
1863	For your review is the draft Construction Expedition Letter per our discussions Monday.
1864	Attached are the documents we discussed.
1864	I have a attached a clean and redline version of the Act of Sale, compared against the prior version we sent.
1864	Upon your final approval, we will prepare executables.
1865	Eric, Texaco Exploration and Production, Inc. owns the other 60%.
1865	The LP is governed by a management committee with two member from Enron and two from Texaco.
1865	I can be your contact for Louisiana Resources.
1865	However, as I stated earlier, I need to know which Louisiana Resources you are talking about.
1865	Is it Louisiana Resources Company or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership.
1865	For Bridgeline the contact would be Robert D. Morgan.
1865	His phone number is 713-345-6374.
1866	Resending.
1866	Thanks.
1867	Attached are my Louisiana counsel's comments to our ROW form.

1875	Please provide any comments you may have.
1876	Jean, We have appointed three new directors for LRCI, Inc. They are yourself, Mark Haedicke, and Brian Redmond.
1876	The records show the current directors as Mark Haedicke and Louise Kitchen, but we were unable to find any resolutions supporting this.
1876	We will clean the records up to reflect the new directors.
1876	Since you and Brian are on the management of Bridgeline, it is a more logical fit for you to be directors.
1876	The resolutions for the Napoleonville Land Sale with the new directors are being circulated for signature.
1876	You may have already seen it.
1876	Let me know if you have any questions.

1883	Your leaving Friday?
1884	Jeff, Attached is the letter with a few comments.
1884	The only substantive comment concerns cost tracking.
1884	We would like to be informed of the overall project costs as they are incurred.
1884	Please see the attached redlined doc.
1884	with my comments.
1884	Let me know if Gulf is OK with these changes.
1884	We would like to get this finalized early tomorrow morning.
1884	Thanks.
1885	The language looks fine to me.
1886	LRCI, Inc. is fine with recording the map.
1887	Lisa, I am fine with the changes.
1887	Just insert the langauge into the confirm under the heading "Processing".

1889	Only a GTC and Master Interruptible.

1890	Is it time to go to Cozumel yet?
1890	Everything is so simple when you're hitting on a ex-stripper while downing a couple of tasty Coronas.
1891	Barbara, My information is as follows: Thanks again for everything you have done for me!
1892	Still here.
1892	Pretty quiet on the floor though.
1892	How hard did your area get hit?
1893	Per my wife's phone conversation with you, please drop the Tennis and Gold membership items from our current account.
1893	The bills should be sent to: 1403 Banks Let me know if you have any questions.
1894	See, its not all bad.
1895	Keegan's Info
1896	I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.
1896	The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.
1896	The above fees look to be OK.
1896	2.
1896	Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40 Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75) Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.
1896	The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.
1896	Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.
1896	3.
1896	Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500 I find no basis for this in the contract.
1896	Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.
1896	So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.
1896	Let me know if you have any questions.
1897	Deb, Could you pull data sheets for me on the following entities: Louisiana Resources Company LRCI, Inc. Louisiana Gas Marketing Company LGMI, Inc. Thanks
1898	Brian, Karen Gruesen, and I had a discussion this morning with Bridgeline.
1898	We agreed that they owed and would pay the lease fees, but the remainder of the charges were not subject to reimbursement.
1898	The only issue was would they reimburse us or pay Dow directly.
1898	They are concerned about netting issues.
1899	Bridgeline was checking the issues on their side concerning payment directly to Dow.
1899	We made it clear that we prefer they directly pay Dow.
1899	They were supposed to get back with Brian later today.
1899	Sorry I didn't make that clear earlier.
1900	I know how you feel.
1900	No way Nebraska should be playing for the championship.
1900	Should be Oregon.
1901	I will see if we can get someone from the bankruptcy team for Wed.
1902	Attached is the review performed so far on the gas contract list you forwarded.
1902	I only reviewed the physical master from Barry's list.
1902	The attached also included some contracts that Frank asked for review.
1902	I will have more updates tomorrow.
1903	Please send of future email updates to: gnemec@houston.rr.com
1904	Leslie, The technical name is: Blanket Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity pursuant to Section 7C of the Natural Gas Act and 18 CFR 284.402.
1905	Your thoughts?
1906	Stuart, I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements: All these contracts are in Enron North America Corp.'s name 1.
1906	Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one. We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings. NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement) This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.
1906	No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.
1906	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).
1906	Thus it is not terminated.
1906	If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.
1906	Term is through January 31, 2018.
1906	2.
1906	First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.
1906	NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.
1906	Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.
1906	Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above. Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).
1906	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).
1906	3.
1906	Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.
1906	ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.
1906	Term is through December 31, 2017.
1906	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).
1906	4.
1906	Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.
1906	ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation.
1906	This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.
1906	Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.
1906	GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.
1906	If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the "Stipulated Loss Value" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.
1906	The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.
1906	Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements.
1907	Mark, I didn't find any gas agreements in the binders that I have.
1907	Most likely since it was done intra-ENA, there was no contract and it was simply booked under a deal ticket.
1907	I will look to see if I can find any paper in our global database for the deal.
1908	I left it with Leslie after I reviewed yesterday.
1909	I don't think there would be any problem with the ECS selling the gas to a third party.
1909	They are currently selling the gas to ENA.
1909	I am not sure how the proceeds from the sale will be handled once ECS recieves them, since ECS is not bankrupt.
1909	I will see if I can find anything out about that.
1909	Eric, you might want to check with Ed and see if he has any insight.
1910	We found no termination notice.
1911	Please see attached.
1911	Please note that that physical gas purchase and sale is as follows: ECS Compression Company LLC receives the gas from TW under the CSA ECS Compression Company LLC sells the gas to Enron Compression Services Company Enron Compression Services Company sells the gas to ENA (Gallup) or to Enron Gas Marketing Corp. (Bisti/Bloomfield)
1912	I would like to nominate OU's 16-13 defeat by OSU as the Most Humiliating Upset of the Year.
1913	At this point, I don't think any assignment to ECS solve any of these issues.
1913	We still have to get approval for any cash outlaws from ECS since it is 100% owned by ENA.
1913	Also assignment from a debtor entity to a non-debtor entity might require certain approvals from the Bankruptcy Ct.
1913	and the DIP financing.
1913	I can look into it if it necessary, but does it really help the cash situation?
1914	Susan, Could you look for and email me the following: Storage Agreement with Montana Power Interruptible Storage Agreement with WBI Transport Agreement with Trailblazer Pipeline Company (Think it was dated around 1995) Sorry for the sketchy info, but that is all that I have.
1914	Thanks.
1915	Bruce, Give me a call when you get a chance.
1915	We have much to talk about in recruiting.
1915	Let's see.......
1915	Albert Hardy, Rodrique Wright, and now Marco Martin.
1915	Unbelievable.
1915	If we could only land Vincent Young.
1916	Kellie, Have you updated the transport list yet?
1917	I still haven't received the final update.
1917	This is the latest.
1918	Do you have anything for HomeTown Communications Network.
1918	Looking for a gas contract dated 6/14/01
1919	No. This must be the Pulp & Paper GTC to which they are referring.
1919	They didn't specifically note it as a gas deal.
1919	Thanks for your help.
1920	Attached is the only I have for Kachina.
1921	Thanks.
1921	Could you also look for a Enfolio Master Firm with Kaztex Energy Management Inc. and ENA dated August 1, 2001.
1922	Debra Perelingiere had prepared this contract.
1922	Since it was done so recently, it may not have made it into the system yet.
1922	Thanks for your help.
1922	I'll check Debra's files.
1923	Jason, To follow up on our discussion last week, Enron Compression Services Company (not a debtor, and owned 100% by ENA) is receiving physical gas under its Compression Services Agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company.
1923	The gas is delivered to ECS on TW's system as consideration for ECS delivery of electric compression services.
1923	This gas was sold by ECS to ENA under a long term Master Firm, but obviously that has blown up.
1923	TW has been desperate to get this gas off of their system since it is packing their pipeline worse every day.
1923	We put into place a GISB with Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd. I made sure there was not cross affiliate netting language in the GISB.
1923	Some of the gas was sold over the Christmas weekend (about 20,000 per day) and more is being sold this week.
1923	We need to put into place a long term sale for the remainder of the term of the compression deals (approximately 7 years) to protect the compression services deals.
1923	Sid may be a potential counterparty, but it may be sold to someone else.
1923	Please provide any input you may have on how we need to structure this sale given the current situation.
1924	In addition to the Philadelphia Gas Works contracts, could you also look for a Husky Oil Operations Limited with ENA dated September 1, 1999.
1924	Thanks.
1925	Thanks Susan.
1925	Can you send me any GTC that would have been for Nov -01 through March 02 business for PGW.
1926	Per my phone conversation with Cheryl Hartsell, I hereby give permission for Unimark LLC to provide a copy of the contract with ENA Upstream Company, LLC dated October 20, 2001 to the producer who gas was sold by Unimark under such contract; provided that Unimark informs such producer of the confidential nature of the contract.
1926	If you need any further information, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.
1927	Attached is a draft of the Dow Amendment.
1927	I used portions of their proposed amendment which they sent of August 8.
1927	Date and prices are left blank for negotiation.
1927	Let me know if you have any questions.
1928	Stuart, I have reviewed your comments and incorporated as appropriate.
1928	Please review attached.
1928	The following are my comments on your changes that I did not accept: 1.
1928	The replacement of Section 3.1 and 3.2 with Section (a), (b), etc. is confusing, but unfortunately the September 1, 2000 amendment already made this replacement.
1928	I am staying with that format.
1928	2.
1928	Since the Original Agreement was awkardly amended in September of 2000, I think the references to the "Original Agreement as amended by Amendment #2" are helpful, so l retained them.
1928	Let me know if you have any questions.
1928	I am OK to send this to Dow if you are.

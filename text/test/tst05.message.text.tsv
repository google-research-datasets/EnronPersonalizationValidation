13	I told you Friday that I would make 2.5 million.
13	The actuals came in right around 1 million due to a correction to the Sumas GD curves and an overestimate of $450,000.
13	Sorry about the mistake.
14	Jeff, Thank you for the resume.
14	I am interested in talking to you about Jennifer Bagwell, as well as discussing the possibility of moving Susan Scott back to my book.

38	Dale, Will you please create the following products for me when you get the chance?
38	I would like to have GD/D HHUB vs EP San Juan, GD/D HHUB vs. EP Permian, GD/D HHUB vs. Malin, and GD/D HHUB vs. Kern/Opal.
38	These will look like the GD/D HHUB vs. SCal that we currently have in EOL.
38	Also, Can I please create three Gas Daily basis products.
38	GD/D BAJA spread - This spread will simply be the GD/D SCAL vs. PG&E Citygate.
38	Call me to discuss.
38	Thank you.
38	Mike Grigsby
39	Please set up the product as Gas Daily Basis GD/D HHUB - SCAL.
39	We will use this until we decide to create a subgroup of daily basis products.
39	Thank you for setting this up today.

40	Bruce, I work with Phillip Allen in West Gas Trading and he talked to Greg Piper about the letter attached below, and Greg told us to forward it to you.
40	Mr. Chase Belew and Mr. Carleson, with E*Steel, would like to meet with you to discuss market opportunities in the global steel market.
40	I would like to have Mr. Belew call you to set up a time to meet with you.
40	Would this be a problem?
40	Please call me to discuss.
40	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
41	I would like to get access to the new westpower website.
41	Phillip Allen asked me to contact you for access.
41	I work with Phillip on the west gas desk.
41	I can be reached at 713-853-7031.
41	Thank you.
41	Mike Grigsby
42	Please make a few minor changes to the Scal product.
42	I would like it read GD/D SCal - HHUB.
42	I apologize about the mistake, but SCAL is a premium to HHUB.
42	We also need to take a look at the description, fixed and floating.
42	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
43	I was out yesterday to become a father and Courtney was rescheduled for Monday.
43	I will call Bruce Garner this morning.
43	His number is 713-345-7321.
43	I will let you know when the baby finally comes.
44	Good morning.
44	Any news on the spread products for the west?
44	The titles are Baja and Redwood spreads.
44	Call me to discuss.
44	Dale is aware of these.
44	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
45	Greg, I wanted to forward this letter to you that I received from a good friend of mine who is interested in discussing global steel trading oppotunities with Enron.
45	If you don't mind, I would like to have Chase Belew call you to possibly set up a meeting.
45	I work on the west gas trading desk.
45	You can reach me at x37031.
45	Thank you for your assistance.
45	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
46	Greg, Are you interested in discussing opportunities with E*steel at another time?
46	I would like to have Mr. Belew call you to set up an appointment in the near future.
46	Let me know what your objective is with Enron Networks, and if you are pursuing the same online platform growth in steel that we are in natural gas.
46	Do you see opportunities in trading steel products as a commodity at some point, and if so, will Enron be active in making markets not only on EOL, but on other platforms?
46	I appreciate your taking the time to entertain their questions.
46	Thank you for your assistance.
46	sincerely, Mike Grigsby Director, West Gas Trading
47	I created the term gd basis products for waha, perm, sj, opal, and malin this weekend.
47	Call Dale or Melba to activate.
47	Keith and I briefly discussed how we would handle the new responsibility.
47	I am fine with managing the prompt month gd basis, while you guys manage the term.
47	I will be back in the office this week and we can talk about the products.
47	Would we handle the monthly the same way?
47	When do we plan to phase the monthly out?
47	Have Phillip manage the perm and waha basis until I return.
47	Dale is also working on the Baja and Redwood on/off system spreads.
47	We can roll these out for all terms as well.
47	See you this week.
48	I am sure that you are aware of the move to daily basis from monthly.
48	The west desk will be trying to phase out monthly for daily in the next month.
48	We have created term gd basis vs. the HHub gd through apr-oct 01 for all index points.
49	Please contact Keith Holst if you should have any questions regarding the new spread products.
49	Please let him know when they are completed.
49	I will be out of the office until Wednesday.
49	Thank you very much.
49	Mike Grigsby
50	Can we create a San Juan phys for Oct bidweek?
50	What did we decide with this product - swing only?
50	If we do, I would like to link it to the basis plus nymex, or to the fixed price gas daily (fixed price gas daily will be rolled out during bidweek this month because of our risk in gd basis going forward).
50	I want to roll the Inside Ferc phys points out during bidweek 7-4, as defined by Inside Ferc, last trade is mid.
50	The NGI index points will be out 7 to 4 during bidweek, as defined by NGI.
50	We will plan on sending the data to both index publications.
50	Time open to market, time of actual trade, counterparty, price, etc. This will be considered their last opportunity to be accurate or we will decline to participate until their numbers are audited.
50	Thanks, Mike
51	When do we expect to hear back from NGI on the sep index?
52	Let's continue to go long sep swing on Socal.
52	I am willing to as long as we can each day.
52	The plan of getting short for OCT bidweek no longer applies because of reduced basis risk in OCT basis.
52	Thanks,
53	Let's continue to buy Socal for the rest of the month.
53	I would like to sell Rockies, and remian neutral on Permian and San Juan, unless it looks like the maint on washington ranch will have a bullish effecst on the basins.
53	I will leave it up to you to determine.
53	I will call later.
53	Mike
54	Can you put a tab together for our phys index positions NOV-MAR?
54	Thanks Mike
55	keep buying N-M socal gd index up to plus .04.
55	I will buy as much as they want to sell.
55	talk to amerex.
55	Mike
56	Steve, Start buying N-M citygate index this week.
56	Pay as much as necessary to get resonable size.
56	I am thinking 100,000/d for the winter.
57	Thanks for the update.
57	Try to stay flat on all gas dailies tomorrow.
57	Our length is good for now.
57	Let's stay flat for now in the oct index.
57	I will be working from home in the morning.
57	Please have Matt email the ops reports to my lotus.
57	Also, please have Patti email her sheets also - the pipeline summary and flow reports.
57	Download the hearme.com software and login on my pc to use the mic, or the headset in one of the drawers on the right.
57	Tell Philip that I will be using Mike
58	Your replies are brief and extremely vague.
58	I will assume that you are not interested.
58	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
59	Thank you for all of the emails.
59	The baby is doing great.
59	Mike
60	Do I not have access to the reports?
60	Please let me know.
60	Mike Grigsby
61	I received an email this morning regarding the reports viewer.
61	I agree with restriciting the access to these sensitive reports, but I don't agree with removing myself from those allowed to review positions.
61	I not only run one of the largest financial books on the floor, but I also manage the West physical book.
61	Phillip Allen passed on the IM WEST physical book to me two months ago.
61	While Phillip acts as manager of the sub books in the west, I am managing all physical positions.
61	Mike Grigsby
62	Yes.
62	I would like to see the var and desk positions.
62	Thank you.

64	Tom, See the email below for the ID and password.
64	Call me on Monday to discuss the download process, if you should have any questions.
64	You will log into www.enrononline.com and I think you will need to download shockwave media (the site should walk you through this process).
64	Once you have typed in the ID and password, you will then have the option of setting up a personalized quote page.
64	Also, call me about where to see our posted daily indices each day on the website.
64	Enron releases the weighted average of all gas traded at each physical point every day.
64	Thanks, Mike
65	Ina, I need to add my son, Clark Watson, to my beneficiary list for medical, etc. Please let me know what I need to do to complete this task.
65	Thank you, Mike
66	Dear Tom, Enron would be interested in getting together with other trading partners to discuss listing other index points at the Socal border.
66	I think the market requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with respect to transportation constraints.
66	The market has clearly seen a divergence in the summer spreads between PG&E and Socal interconnects.
66	The marginal generation load in SP-15 and Southern California this summer has proven that Socal Gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting daily demand with flowing supplies, and will be incapable of injecting gas during these months.
66	Because of this, supply being transported from the Southwest supply basins can only find a home going into PG&E.
66	This places downward pressure on PG&E Topock gas and upward pressure on Socal Topock gas.
66	Remember, Socal is an island, not because of the delivered capacity to the border via EPNG and TW, but because of the limited capacity of Socal's interconnects.
66	Demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity.
66	There is also a divergence between Ehrenberg and Topock because of liquidity.
66	Topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport contracts on EPNG and downstream buying patterns of certain Socal markets.
66	The market is more diversified at Topock than Ehrenberg.
66	The overwhelming demand pressure on Socal gets exposed at Topock.
66	Although Ehrenberg is the marginal point for gas into Socal, there is more of an imbalance in upstream capacity (EPNG and TW) to downstream capacity (Socal Topock 545,000/d) at Socal Topock than at Ehrenberg.
66	The Socal Ehrenberg interconnect has 1.1 bcf of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter.
66	Ehrenberg simply gets placed at "market prices" because of varying objectives.
66	One transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smaller buyers on Socal may not approach this transporter for supplies.
66	This illiquidity has led to a spread existing between Topock and Ehrenberg.
66	Picture the market, San Juan gas is trading well below the Permian and Waha basins, which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west.
66	Because of the of the limited capacity going into Socal Topock, every transporter on EPNG and TW wants to fill their contracts with San Juan gas first.
66	These molecules compete for Buyers at a limited delivery interconnect.
66	Likewise, all Buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery interconnect (Topock).
66	The San Juan then trys to find an outlet going east on the SJ east leg of EPNG.
66	This transport leg simply displaces Permian gas going into Plains North and allows Permian gas to head west to Ehrenberg on the EPNG south mainline.
66	While the Socal market peaks in the summer, so does the EOC demand.
66	Permian west (Keystone West meter) cannot satisfy both the EOC demand and the Socal demand.
66	So for the first time ever, we saw EPNG Waha West at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the EPNG south mainline.
66	This tells the entire story.
66	When demand exceeds all available historical supply points, and begins to reach to Waha to meet Ehrenberg demand, you have a paradigm shift.
66	This eliminates any correlation that may have existed between the supply basins and the market area.
66	When Keystone West reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeding the max rate transport rate then dies a fast death.
66	There is simply no available capacity at the Keystone West meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate transport on EPNG and ship it to Socal.
66	If you asked the market what the maximum interconnect capacity at Keystone West is, 9 out of 10 would not know.
66	This leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are above historical levels.
66	It is like Al Gore blaming "big oil companies" for the high prices of gas, when all refineries are at maximum capacity.
66	There simply isn't the capacity to meet demand.
66	The supply exists, but there isn't enough refining capacity available to meet demand.
66	Fundamentals rule the market in all cases.
66	I would like to propose the following index points for the Southern California border.
66	The market would be better served with supply being included in these index points.
66	One, Socal CA production/Socal storage/EPNG Ehrenberg, Two, Topock TW and EPNG, Three, KRS/Wheeler Ridge.
66	The market will be experiencing more changes with respect to the Socal restructuring in the future.
66	We will then address the different interconnects and propose an index for the Socal citygate as well.
66	Call me on Monday to discuss the Enron Online download.
66	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby Director of West Trading
67	Dear Tom, I am glad you like the website.
67	When you go into the personalize myquotes filter, select the commodity, region, and products.
67	You will need to scroll down the products list and select the US GAS phys index points of interest to you.
67	Please call me if you have any problems.
67	Your filter can then be sorted by right clicking on the filter at the column heading.
67	You can sort by five different groupings.
67	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
68	Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.
68	Thank you for the invite the other day.
68	I just had my second child, so I am little busy.
68	We will be turning on the box with natsource gas daily today.
68	I apologize for the inconvenience.
68	The information reported internally warranted suspending business with Natsource for a few days.
68	I am not interested in hearing your side of the story.
68	Business as usual here forward.
68	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
69	The box will be turned on Wednesday.
69	Thanks for the email regarding my baby.
69	Talk to you in the morning.
69	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
70	Will you transfer all of the existing SJ 100% flow deals to the new curve?
70	Please coordinate with the desk to identify all deals executed prior to the new curve being created.
70	Thanks, Mike
71	Call me to discuss my discussions with the guy in charge of steel.
71	The guy was most disturbing.
71	There will not be any opportunity to contact this guy in the near future.

72	She will be managing the OCT SJ, PERM, Scal, Opal, etc. basis spreads to the Henry Hub.

72	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
73	Thank you for contacting me.
73	The new baby is doing great.
73	I would like to add you guys to the box if you are interested.
73	I would also like to have your west physical guys on my box.
73	It has been brought to my attention that APB has great fixed price physical flow.
73	If you are not aware, I am running the physical desk as well.
73	Let everyone know that it will based on one condition - All numbers or no numbers.
73	We do not wish to participate in a closed market.
73	Call me later.
73	Mike Grigsby
74	call me before 12:10.
74	i am taking a half day.
75	Please order two new monitors for me.
75	I will be adding the two to the left of the four screens I currenly have.
75	please request the arms as well.
75	thanks mike
76	Please add PG&E citygate GD/D - HHub GD (basis) to the database.
76	Also, I would like to check on the status of the Baja spread product.
76	Please sweep the new products in FIN basis, Fin swaps, and non-tx physical <or= to 1 month.
76	Thanks, Mike
77	Will you please get me access to manage the SJ physical product?
77	I would like to link it for prompt month information.
77	Thanks, Mike
78	Thank you very much.
78	Mike
79	Thank you, but shouldn't the products be listed as follows.
79	GD/D PG&E what you think.
79	How would the legal description read?
79	Thanks, Mike
80	Please read the following email from EOL.
80	I have asked them to assist the West desk in mailing out an ad to all of our customers (utilities, producers, industrials, and some IPPs) notifying them of our plan to reduce the minimum volume accepted on all of our EOL products.
80	Start thinking of which customers should be on the list and try to think of a creative way to present this to our customers.
80	EOL has asked us to provide them with the text of our message.
80	Also, let's go ahead and reduce the min volume on our products (primarily all phys and gas dailies) this week.
80	We are attempting to capture all of the odd lot flow in the market.
80	I would see this service as a clear advantage over the other web platforms.
80	Let's get together on Friday afternoon at Ninfa's to discuss our ideas.
80	Thanks, Mike
81	Hello.
81	The west gas desk would like to send a mailout to our EOL customers regarding the new opportunity to trade "odd lots" on every physical product.
81	EOL has been instrumental in providing liquidity to previously illiquid physical delivery points in the west for standard volumes of 5000 mmbtu/d and greater, but we would like to notify our customers that EOL will now accommodate odd size lots, in 1 mmbtu increments.
81	This will allow us to trade the "non-standard" volumes with all of the market.
81	Do we have a creative team that might be able to assist us in our efforts?
81	We were thinking about a one page mailout with a clear message.
81	We would like it to be very upbeat and funny.
81	Thank you for your assistance.
81	I can be reached at x37031.
81	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby Director, West Gas trading
82	Let's begin rolling out the cash products at 7:15 am.
82	We should also get back to the cash strategy of the desk each morning.
82	Let's start testing the market, find the support and resistance each day.
82	It would be nice to have EOL change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button, and not go through the product properties.
82	I'll call them tomorrow.
82	Let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning.
82	We want to send the message of reliability, but also allow our Ops group to balance and nom.
82	I want to begin trading the next day cash by 11:01 am every day.
82	This would stay active until 4:00.
82	The push is for PHYSICAL.
82	Our edge over the market will be phys.
82	From risk to the ability to nominate and invoice, the other platforms will never see it coming.
82	What are the chances that ICE and espeed will deal with el paso flows?
82	If information is the reason for EOL, then this will provide it.
82	It all seems so simple - Fixed priced physical, just when you thought it was old economy.
82	The reliable indices to big position trading to EOL market share, all benefit under the new mantra.
82	Mike
83	Great.
83	Can you come to trading floor around 11:30 am on Wednesday?
83	I am located at 3210C.
83	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
84	We will launch as soon as we get the mailout to our customers.
84	Mike
85	The Gas Daily basis issue should be worked out between your desk and the monthly basis desk.
85	We are making markets on GD basis for every term and index point.
85	This creates a nice market for term gd index.
85	Let us know how you guys would like to cover the gd basis with us.
85	The real opportunity for gd basis is at socal, where the monthly index is so unreliable.
85	Mike
86	Nice job on the postcard.
86	I will get you an answer on the mailout tomorrow morning.
86	Let me know if you hear anything from EOL regarding the new version.
86	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
87	After continuing to play musical chairs with the west eol products, I think we have decided on a plan.
87	Keith and Frank will handle the prompt and term basis.
87	This includes the monthly basis, daily basis, and gd index for SJ, ROX, Scal, CG, and Malin.
87	They will make certain that the gd index products are out there for all terms.
87	Cary Metz is managing the Perm products.
87	I will handle the prompt month physical fixed price and index for all of the index points.
87	The term physical index will be coming soon.
87	The rest of the group will continue to manage their cash index points for the next day trading, while adding the BOM physical with a basis link to Monique's GD BOM products.
87	I would like to get the cash products out on eol by 7:15 each morning.
87	The early info will come in handy as we approach winter.
87	Let me know what you think.
87	Steve and Matt have started a pilot program in the NW for rolling out their next day cash products after 11:00 am each day.
87	We will look into rolling out the SW in the future.
87	We are in the process of sending out the "odd lot" notice to our customers regarding all products on eol.
87	We will change our product minimum to one mmbtu in the next week.
87	You may want to discuss this with your direct customers before the mailout.
87	With the addition of Olivia Newton-John to my Scour selection, it is no secret that we have a new commitment to physical in the west.
87	If you review your customer contact sheet and discover an old customer that we haven't contacted in some time, then call them and visit.
87	We will be using EOL and the brokers for physical volumes, but nothing beats the direct phone call for the baseload phys.
87	Thanks, Mike
88	Let's plan on mailing this out to the US customers only.
88	Call me today to discuss the eol new version.
88	Thanks, Mike
89	Please sweep the products in phys non-tx<1 month and phys index non TX<1 month.
89	Also, i need access to view restricted products in product manager for non-tx phys forward and index<1 month.
89	Thanks, Mike
90	Thank you very much.

91	Ina, I can't seem to find the expense deposit for the SW Bell charges in my account.
91	Will you please contact them again and ask them for a copy of the check?
91	Thank you so much.
91	Mike
92	Dear Dan, Thank you for contacting me, but I am quite content with my current opportunities at Enron.
92	Thank you so much for your interest.
92	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby Director of Trading
93	I like this report.
93	Can it be put into the same format as the other "access" reports?
93	Thanks for all of your work on this project.
93	You are doing a great job.
93	Mike
94	This is the data that we will use to build our Socal growth estimates.
94	Take a look at the file and then we can discuss how to combine this with current pipeline capacity and future expansions.
94	Mike
95	Hey guys.
95	Let's try this.
95	Take the data from 2000 and change the following.
95	Take Keystone West volumes to 850,000/d rateably, then add the new gen numbers posted below.
95	You will need to add this demand to the EOC S ML demand numbers (Is Salmayuca included in this number?).
95	We should use the 2000 waha west volumes for now.
95	You should end up with reduced ehrenberg volumes for the reduction in Keystone west volumes and the addition of New Gen demand.
95	Run the storage balance at 2000 Socal in this scenario.
95	We will then plug forward with waha west volumes to balance Socal in 2001.
95	Also, add columns to adjust (90%, 60%, 50%, etc) the burns for new gen in SW.
95	We should then look to adjusting socal demand down for the high hydro/increased NW imports to CA scenario that could happen.
95	Use the SP-15 2000 gen numbers and then back out the avg of 1999 and 2000 power imports.
95	I would like to avoid averaging 1999 and 2000 socal gas demand.
95	Use a 10,000 heat rate to reduce gas demand.
95	Have Jay adjust EOC demand for normal weather.
95	We may have to refer to the load sensitivity data from west power to reduce the SW electric loads and then back out of gen numbers using a 10,000 heat rate.
95	We will then be exposed to EPNG and the OPS increasing Keystone west volumes between now and next summer - run the 2001 with this possibility as well.
95	Take Key West to 1.1 bcf.
95	Let me know where my errors in approach may be.
95	This should give us a picture of the Socal deliverability for 2001.
95	Thanks, Mike
96	Please create the following monthly for daily swap.
96	IF GD/D CIG (N SYS).
96	The GD index is listed under CIG (N. Sys) on page two.
96	The monthly index is listed as CIG Rocky Mountain.
96	Thank you, Mike Grigsby
97	This looks good.
97	Thanks, Mike
98	Ina, thank you for the site.
98	Will you please have me added to the site access?
98	I tried to login without success.

100	Hello JJ.
100	The Clark family will have me traveling to Abilene on this day.
100	I hate to miss the highlight of the X-MAS holiday.
100	Let me know what the plans are for New Year's Eve this year.
100	Will you guys be in Houston?
100	I hope Dallas is treating you well.
100	We can't wait to see Michael.
100	Clark and Jake are doing great.
101	no attachments included
102	My address is 6201 Meadow Lake 77057 and my home phone is 713-780-1022.
102	The horns looked great last week.
102	Chris Simms is alive.
102	The best quarterback performance I have ever seen in Memorial stadium since Peter the Great.
102	Just think if we had Phil Brown running the ball.
102	Grigs
103	We will need to discuss how to adjust physical risk to match the flow constraints on EPNG.
103	The currrent capacity cuts in the SJ and Socal topock delivery points are 50%.
103	I would like my P&L to show this risk.
103	Please find a way to adjust the positions according to a daily flow curve that can be set in newcurrentday by either myself or Monique.
103	Also, We will need to set up a new physical curve for Mojave Topock.
103	Our transport is currently being reallocated by EPNG for deliveries to Mojave instead of Socal topock.
103	I would like to show the transport on EPNG value as SJ plus cost to Mojave and have the value roll out each month, if any.
103	The risk is showing the value of SJ to Socal topock (currently wide spreads for 2001) on the transport when it actually has less value delivering to Mojave Sincerely, Mike
104	The position sheet from yesterday afternoon, close of business, is quite different than the position posted in newcuurentday for 11/29.
104	What do you think the difference is?
104	The SJ, Perm, and Socal don't match.
104	Are we booking them correctly.
104	Let me know.
104	Ask Anne to reconcile each day with comments on the prompt tab.
104	Thanks, Mike
105	Are we confident that the gda priced positions are not being represented in my newcurrentday position sheet?
105	I know that Phillips triggered their volumes back to GDA equivalent and that Matt Lenhart bought some GDA malin gas.
105	How do we keep these from showing up in the physical risk?
105	Mike
106	Thank you.
106	Can you also address the question about gda physical volumes not showing up in my position manager?
106	Let me know.
106	Mike
107	Ina, Will you please add the following fax number to the fax memory button that Pete Keavey uses to submit daily prices.
107	The NGW fax number is 202-347-8089.
107	Anne, Starting tonight, will you add NGW to the monthly bidweek email and index postings.
107	Send the documents to SSpeaker@energyintel.com Thanks, Mike
108	The PG&E basis position in TDS does not match the FEB/MAR position.
108	The Baja spread was executed as a NOV-MAR position months ago.
108	The only real changes were to Socal basis over time.
108	There is no telling when this might have changed in error.
108	Will you please research the position to see when this position was reduced.
108	I am guessing that a park and loan was executed by Frank Ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to GD New by mistake.
108	Thanks, Mike
109	Okay, I think the tds tab in newcurrentday was wrong.
109	It is showing a jan pos of 269.55 lots, but TDS is showing 539.1.
109	False alarm.
109	We will fix Mike
110	Anne, We need to delete the two trades listed under rockies that are priced 13.90 and 14.00.
110	Please move these trades to Sumas and resend the data to the publications with an explanation.
110	The index for rox should be 5.9125 after you make the changes.
110	Thanks, Mike
111	It looks like Anne accidentally include two Sumas trades in the Rockies data priced at 13.90 and 14.00.
111	She will send out a revised spreadsheet on Thursday.
111	The Rockies Opal wacog will then be $5.913.
111	Sorry for the error.
111	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby Director, West Trading
112	Did we send the odd lot trading postcard to all of our customers?
112	I didn't know it was sent out.
112	What was the response, etc.?
112	Our RC number is 105891.
112	Thank you, Mike Grigsby
113	What do you thnk about amazon gift certificates of $30.00 to the group?
113	Let's put the "Tick" on selling mojave index for feb-oct 2001.
113	heavy orig if he can find a nice market.
113	Let's put Ina on the west desk trip for Feb. We should book it now to send a nice message to the group after our last cancellation.
114	Good morning.
114	With the energy crisis in California at this time, we will need to be extra careful with nominations at Socal and throughout the west to ensure that we continue to provide the excellent nomination service that we have been providing to our customers.
114	You guys are doing an excellent job and we understand that you are under quite a bit of pressure with limited staff.
114	Our contracts state that we must notify every customer of pipeline allocations 12 hours in advance.
114	We all know that this can be almost impossible on EPNG, but because of the current price levels at Socal and the basins, Enron needs to call each customer and notify them of their cuts with an explanation of the pipeline cuts each day to avoid any potential penalties.
114	We also need to document when the call was made.
114	In regards to the ATM nominations on Socal (ones that we can't monitor), Enron will be requesting full pipeline summaries of the nominations from our counterparties.
114	Please try to think of any nomination gaming that may take place at these historical levels.
114	We need to remember that our counterparties may not act as they have in the past due to the market price implications on their P&L.
114	We should not rely on prior business conduct in regards to "standard epng allocations" when dealing with our customers.
114	I would expect that the market is going to overreact to any cuts that may be above the "pipeline average".
114	Let's discuss how we are going to monitor the flows of nominations out of our control.
114	How do we prevent collusion with respect to the socal nominations that we can't see?
114	Are there package numbers on each baseload contract to ensure that they don't simply reshuffle gas according to price?
114	Let me know which companies are not providing Enron with timely allocation reports at Socal and I will call their senior trader to discuss getting this operational information sooner.
114	Sincerely, Mike
115	Any word on the sw bell charges for DSL service?
115	Also, will you have houston cellular activate my voice mailbox?
115	Thanks, Mike
116	Anne, We would like to know the P&L for trading California gas this year for physical only.
116	Please run a report summarizing the P&L at Socal Topock, PG&E then need to notify John Lavorado of the results.
116	Thanks, Mike
117	Please send the sources of our ferc CA analysis to becky cantrell.
117	She needs to include the sources with the filing.
118	Please add Carey Metz to our bidweek index survey spreadsheet.
118	Thanks.
118	Mike
119	I would like to add electronic index descriptions to the database.
119	Please refernece Gas Daily publication, page three for the location of these indices.
119	We can simply insert the location of the electronic index where we currenly have the gas daily index survey language in the gd swaps in the database.
119	I would like to have electronic gd swaps for the following points.
119	El Paso Permian, El Paso , non-bondad, Kern River/Opal Plant, Socal Gas, large packages.
119	We will need to add electronic to the product title to differentiate between the two gd swaps.
119	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
120	Let's discuss the following.
120	Making markets on GD swaps and managing the risk Hiring a new analyst to track our spreadsheets, create our products and get them ready to trade each morning.
120	Your Access EOL reports.
120	Get it to a level that Ina might be able to download the data each day.
120	Talk to Susan about joining the group.
120	Mike
121	I have been thinking about the cash book idea for group and I think we need to discuss this in more detail.
121	I would like to continue to use the physical for large prompt positions going forward.
121	I am afraid that the baseload volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books.
121	We need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk.
121	i.e. Intra regional spreads with GD swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty.
121	Janie managing SJ and laying off risk on Steve's Opal.
121	I know that the cash books would be a good idea for dailies , but I am not sure how to do this without giving up the cash risk for baseload as well.
121	What are your thoughts?
121	I would also like to discuss the staffing issues.
121	Matt Smith and Susan Scott to analyst, Jay to the ROX, etc. It seems like Ken S. has shown more interest in the west fundies lately.
121	Should we keep his services?
121	The basis products need another book.
121	Who can we add to the mix?
121	I think that we should look into having Frank focus on prompt month only.
121	He has a great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing tight two ways for all products on the prompt.
121	Keith can do term with another book.
121	Monique is going to take over the gd swaps for Kern, SJ, and Perm.
121	I will continue to manage the CA products.
121	This should allow us to provide tighter two ways across the west.
121	I will continue to manage all index products and prompt month phys fixed price.
121	Operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows.
121	The analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to nom the market.
121	EOL.
121	Keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager's markets.
121	We should propose this to EOL.
121	This would allow for tighter markets on all products and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers.
121	Ca cash products.
121	Let's call a meeting about how to offer more Socal physical products.
121	I would like to have PG&E topock and Socal Ehrenberg before the summer.
121	Mike
122	Please activate all draft products in finswaps, and nontx phys and phys index (all terms) including restricted SJ.
122	Thank you very much.
122	Please call me when they are activated.
122	Mike Grigsby
123	Barry, I would like to focus our deal flow on Apr-Oct or 1 yr San Juan and Rockies supply.
123	Our fundamental investment is mainly in the rockies for 2001.
123	Let's get together with Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci, and others to set our supply goals for the mainly the apr-oct period.
123	I would like to work on buying every mmbtu of Opal, and all points included in the IF NW Rockies index.
123	Our goal should be to purchase at least 400,000/d of rockies supply and 500,000/d of San Juan Blanco and Bondad.
123	we have been buying these phys index points at +.01 in the rockies and +.005 in the San Juan.
123	You may need to coordinate with Fred Lagrosta's group initially to get all of their producer contacts.
123	Thanks, Mike
124	Thank you for the email.
124	It sounds like everything is going well for you.
124	We are in Portland this week hanging out with the boys.
124	Planning to go skiing in Bachelor this afternoon.
124	We'll see you in Houston one of these days.
124	Take care, Mike
125	Thank you for the email.
125	It has been a long ride since I began my morning's sitting with you on the old GD desk.
125	I hear your name all of the time, but rarely run into you.
125	I hope to see you soon.
125	Sincerely, Mike
126	Matt, Please take a look at these spreadsheets and calc the gas usage by plant and by pipe in CA.
126	Chris Foster is telling us that most of these palnts will be shutting down in the next few weeks due to credit exposure.
126	Let's discuss the impact on sendouts.
126	Thanks,
127	Congratulations to you as well!
127	I am looking forward to working with you and the Denver office.
127	We are excited about the term opportunities in the west this year.

128	Thank you for the email.
128	I hope everything is going well.
128	The gas market is up to its same old tricks this year.
128	Keep in touch.
128	Sincerely, Mike
129	Fixing the PG&E topock curve to Socal less .25 would only allocate more positive income to the transport.
129	The position at topock is short.
129	I am not sure if this is the problem from Friday.
129	Let's get together in the morning.
129	Thanks for the email.
129	Sincerely, Mike
130	Can i get my ehronline id?
130	Thanks.

131	Will I get access to the VP investment program for this year's bonus?
131	Let's push for this if not.
132	Sorry.
132	The topock curve should be marked as Socal flat.
132	Remember that we show the differentials in index spreads.
132	Please make certain that the pg&e topock curves are flat to socal in the future.
132	Can we run a report showing the curveshift spread between the two points since Jan 1, 2001?
132	Thanks.
132	Mike
133	Please check the physical and fin index positions for prompt.
133	The index totals do not match the volumes in the Consindex tab in newcurrentday.
133	Thanks, Mike
134	Please review the transport for next month and make certain that it is set up correctly for market prices.
134	Perm to Socal based on current spreads, SJ to Waha on EPNG, SJ to Waha on TW, etc. The SJ to Waha spread is .20 for next month, does the transport work at these spreads?
134	Please make the changes before prebid.
134	Also, please put in a good burn estimate for Citizens next month.
134	Please prepare to supply our socal pool with non-topock gas 100% next month.
134	Thanks, Mike
135	I will look over the options on Tuesday and get back to you as soon as possible.
135	Thank you, Mike

145	Name, address, home phone, work phone, cell phone, and email.
145	Thank you so much.
145	Mike
146	I have asked Bob Badeer to help us research what the utilization rate of gas fired plants in the west was last year and what, if any, the impact of lower hydro and even warmer temps would mean to gas consumption in 2001.
146	We need to account for any political changes in air pollution credits this year that may increase gas consumption in 2001.
146	Let's discuss in the afternoon.
146	3:30 meeting.
147	Would it be okay if we went ahead and rolled the socal and baja transport in sitara?
147	I would like to input the Socal transport through October 2001, San Juan to PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock (ask Janie for the allocation in April).
147	The Baja transport is through March 2002.
147	80000/d to Citygate and This will really help me monitor my physical index exposure on the curve.
147	Let's get together and discuss tomorrow.
147	Thanks, Mike
148	We would like to schedule our trip to Cancun, Ritz Carlton for March 29, Thursday through Sunday.

151	Take a look at the rates for Cayman.

151	Mike
152	No. I will not agree to any penalty charges on nomination errors.

155	Please make certain that all physical positions are loaded correctly in NCD for term.
155	Have Patti Sullivan load all transport from the transport model in sitara so that the physical index positions will be recognized in NCD.
155	This would include SJ/Perm to Socal through OCT, Baja through MAR 20001 (100,000/d to Malin(Barry), Steve South's latest transport deal from Kingsgate/Stanfield to Malin, and any SJ to Waha transport. Anne, did you get a ticket from Steve on the transport mentioned above? Also, let me know what the status of the transport deal from Kingsagte to Malin with Barry. Is the gd index for Perm position loading correctly in NCD for Apr-Oct? Mo, please carry out the physical positions in NCD through Mar 2001. Thanks! Mike
156	did we get the 5/d rox at plus .02 yesterday?

159	Thank you, Mike
160	Thank you.
160	We are really excited about the "big Hos" (Jake's new comment).

160	We will take some pictures this weekend with the digital camera and email them to you.
160	Mike
161	Thank you.
161	Is there a sitara report that we can run to show the transport in the system through March 2001.
161	Thank you, Mike
162	Nice work.
162	Thanks for the help.
162	Mike
163	Thank you.
163	i don't need the value.
163	I just need the sitara transport report so that I may check the physical positions.
163	Mike
164	Take a look at my review and let me know if we should any more of your 2000 accomplishments.
164	I need to get this in your file for HR.
164	Mike
165	How do I get the software to operate Socal Gasselect and Passport?
165	I would like to have them installed on my desktop and laptop.
165	Thanks, Mike
166	Patti, will you please review each of the SW Gas deals on this spreadsheet and let me know which deals they penalized us for?
166	We are looking to see if they have been penalizing multiple deals or one deal in particular.
166	They claim that all one month deals fall under an IT contract that cannot be penalized.
166	I want to make certain that they did not penalize one month deals.
166	Thanks, mike
167	Dear Jeff, I am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region and identifying any problems (i.e. penalty language, notification deadlines for OFOs, etc.) that may need to be addressed.
167	We have experienced a few problems with SW Gas Corp. recently.
167	They have been penalizing Enron for cuts on EPNG, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month deal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an interruptible contract and cannot be penalized.
167	This was news to me.
167	Can you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact business with our customers in the west?
167	I can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west desk for some time.
167	Phillip Allen transferred the desk to me in August of 2000 and I have not spent the time to review all of contracts.
167	Let's get together and discuss exactly what I may need.
167	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
168	Ina, Please have the IT group delete all copies of ICE and Altrade from the west desk.
168	I think Randy is the only one.
168	Thanks, Mike
169	Jeff, Did you allow me access to all gas reports on Executive reports viewer?
169	Let me know.
169	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
170	It is my understanding that Susan will be starting her new job on the west desk Monday morning.
170	We are couting on having her full time beginning the same day.
170	Let me know if I am incorrect.
170	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
171	Please remind me of this class.
171	Thanks.
172	We should change all settlements at Socal to NGI Southern Border, Socal from Southern California Border average.
172	This new index excludes KRS fixed priced trades.
172	Please let the brokers know about the changes to Socal basis going forward.
172	Please change basis and gd swing swaps (fp and index) in EOL.
172	Also, Frank and Matt should set up basis and a gd swap (fp and index) for southern border, PG&E.
172	This will be the index for PG&E Topock.
172	This index will be effective for April 2001.
172	I will have the physical product out there as soon as possible.
172	Let me know when they have been changed.
172	Mike
173	Will you please set up two new indices in the database.
173	The first one will be NGI Southern Border, Socal.
173	This is different for the current NGI Socal border index in the system.
173	Also, please set up NGI Southern Border, PG&E.
173	Let me know when they have been added.
173	These indices will begin posting in NGI for April, 2001.
173	Thank you, Mike Grigsby
174	Please activate long term phys index products in draft.
174	They are one year index products 02-04.
174	Thanks, Mike
175	I will submit the move request for the west desk on Monday.
175	We should have Anne fill this spot.
175	I would like her to keep track of New Current day and all new deals that flow through the desk.
175	She can coordinate tickets to your group and make sure that they get booked throughout the day.
175	She can also put physical deals in Sitara.
175	Let me know what the desktop PC will need to be loaded with.
175	Start thinking of other tasks that she might be able to accomplish so that your group may get home at an earlier time each day.
175	You can keep this desk for your own use and rotate people through as needed.
175	Thanks, Mike
176	Let's start thinking about transitioning SJ to 100% flow.
176	I would like to discuss all of the issues and costs of presenting such a product to the market.
176	Think about what we might need in the form of Northwest transport, storage, operations personnel, etc. I realize that this will be risky and that I may experience some financial downside with this endeavor, but I think we should press forward.
176	Will we need intra-day traders to place the gas?
176	Do we need to establish intra-day relationships with SJ producers, utilities, etc?
176	Will the allocation on EL Paso in April alleviate some of the cuts?
176	Let's discuss in detail.
176	Mike
177	What is this for?
178	Will you please set up the 100% flow SJ product?
178	I would like the title to be just like the current EP product - no mention of 100% flow on the title.
178	I would like to avoid making this a separate index posting.
178	Let's make this available to the entire market.
178	Thanks, Mike
179	Let's set up the new indices on Tues.
179	PG&E topock and Socal border.
179	Matt and Frank will set up new products for gd swaps and basis.
179	I am working on the phys index.
179	Keith will change the socal index from Southern CA border average to Southern border, Socal.
179	This new index excludes KRS.
179	Grigs
180	Please let me know when our new socal and pg&e index descriptions are available.
180	Also, please activate the phys index producst in draft - one year terms 02-04.
180	Thanks, Mike
181	Anne, on the last day of the month we need to send in the index before noon.
182	We ar so proud of you.
182	Mike
183	Yours.
183	I hate golf.
183	Thanks for thinking of me.
184	I would like to take a quiet stroll with you in a dark alley.
185	Thank you.
185	Will you please show me the detail from yesterday's difference and today's difference?
185	Mike
186	Let's have Matt start on the following: Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.
186	Begin forecasting hourly and daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and then using temps to estimate core gas load.
186	Back testing once he gets database created should help him forecast core demand.
186	Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.
186	Also, break out new gen by EPNG and TW pipelines.
186	Mike
187	Matt, your new responsibility for 7:30 meeting will be to go over all gen outages in the west by region and fuel type, and to discuss the previous days gen numbers and load forecasts.
187	Including pricing info and heat rates from the Portland guys and/or Megawatt Daily will also help.
187	Effective on Thursday.
187	Thanks, Mike
188	Dear John, I had a meeting with Phillip after our morning discussion about P&L and it seems that there may be some issues regarding how I run my book.
188	It was my mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were booked properly.
188	The options were booked properly by Larry May and my Book runners and the profit was realized for 03/08.
188	My apologies for declaring that the options were not in my position.
188	Also, the tolls curves are not treated as schedule C. I will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift as needed.
188	My P&L did not match the Socal position because of physical index curveshift and an adjustment to transport.
188	The discussion and feedback from Phillip regarding your conversation with him concerns me.
188	I am confident that I run the most accurate physical and financial trading book within Enron.
188	I will stand on the fact that no one within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than I. The physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen at Enron since I have been here.
188	Few people realize the great lengths I go to to manage the risk in the IM West trading book.
188	I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it is responsible for communicating with you directly.
188	Let's get together and discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward.
188	It may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Phillip Allen up until this point.
188	This may have contributed to my miscommunication with you.
188	I will see that this will not happen in the future.
188	Thank you for all of my added responsibilities.
188	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
189	Pablo, Will you stop by when you get a chance to do the following: 1.
189	set up network connection to laptop 2.
189	download passport and gasselect on desktop and laptop 3.
189	level the monitors Thanks, Mike
190	Melba, Please set up the Souther border, PG&E and Southern Border, Socal inices in the database.
190	We have new risk coming in April that needs to find a market soon on EOL.
190	We can have NGI send you the new index posting if you need it.
190	Also, please acitvate long term index products of one year.
190	There is also a PG&E topock phys product in the one month category for april that needs to be activated.
190	I look forward to hearing from you Monday morning.
190	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
191	You guys have no chance of building a strong presence here at Enron.
191	Susan and I will make sure of it.
191	Stick to the Galant Night and Blancos.
192	Melba, Thank you for your assistance.
192	These look good.
192	Mike
193	Please check the gd swap cheyenne positions for March.
193	I am confident that I have cheyenne short positions on this month, but they are not showing up in the intraday tab.
193	Please check to see if they are booked as kern/opal by mistake.
193	Thank you.
193	Mike
194	Mark, Please describe in detail, the downstream capacity available to transport this gas.
194	How does the CIG capacity being sold to Coastal impact this point?
194	If you can make the case for this gas flowing without constraint, then I see no problem in making a fixed price bid for the full volume.
194	A rough sketch of the gas location and its downstream flow options would be nice.
194	Thanks, Mike
195	Let's talk to Matt about the forecast sheets for Socal and PG&E.
195	He needs to work on the TW sheet as well.
195	Also, I would like him to create a sheet on pipeline expansions and their rates and then tie in the daily curves for the desk to use.
195	Mike
196	The index products look great.
196	Can you have the same constraint language included on the PG&E Topock location for creating the phys forward (fixed price) product?
196	Let me know when that is done.
196	Thank you.
196	Mike
197	Frank, The new procedures for trading basis are working well.
197	We still need to get the desk comfortable with submitting orders to you guys, but overall I am pleased with the new procedure.
197	I need to work on staying out of the basis market entirely going forward.
197	Can you also try to work all basis at Socal through Keith.
197	Let Keith and Mo see all of your Socal/Malin spreads in the future.
197	I think I gave you an order to work Apr-Oct 02 socal/malin at the same time Keith was trying to sell a-o 02 socal basis.
197	I will let him know in the future so that we do not cross him in the market.
197	Thanks, Mike
198	We have created the new southern border index products for Socal and PG&E topock.
198	Please create your new basis and gas daily products for these indices as soon as possible.
198	Mattt will need to create the gd index products as well.
198	Let the brokers know about the new indices I have the back office setting up new curves to book these deals.
198	You will have two curves for Socal now.
198	The curves will show your risk on the old index, as well as the new index.
198	The new Socal index is the same as the old except that excludes KRS.
198	I will be taking these phys products out on EOL as soon as possible.
198	Thanks, Mike
199	Steve, Let's discuss all of your new rox products for EOL.
199	I would like to know which products to roll out on EOL for April bidweek.
199	I would also like to discuss creating a south of Muddy Creek product for Kern gas.
199	I would assume that it would fall under the IF Kern index.
199	Thanks, Mike
200	Melba, Will you please take a look at the term non-texas index products greater than one year and activate them?
200	The section is numbered (1126) in product manager.
200	Thanks, Mike
201	Please activate all index producst in section 1125.
201	Non Texas phys index less than one year.
201	PG&E, SOCAL, and Socal Ehrenberg.
201	Thanks, Mike
202	Is the Baja for April transport in sitara?
202	Please let me know.
202	Thanks, MIke
203	Can we scrub the transport model P&L for yesterday?
203	Did the transport being switched to PG&E topock show any losses?
203	Let me know the breakdown.
203	Thanks, Mike
204	Please review the transport positions in sitara for next month.
204	We should have the Baja transport included.
204	100,000 short for PG&E topock, 80,000 long Citygate, and 20,000 long KRS.
204	The sj to socal transport should be broken out to like 24,000 topock, 14,000 mojave, and the balance to pg&e topock.
204	Also, please check on the kingsgate to malin and stanfield to malin for next month.
204	What about sj to waha?
204	Patti, please run a report showing all of the sitara transport deals.
204	Thank you!
204	Mike
205	I made some big changes to the index curves tonight.
205	Please run a new P&L early in the morning in order to estimate what the changes in book value will be.
205	I will need to let John Lavorado know about the changes to the curves before we decide to book these tomorrow.
205	Please run a report from the transport model so that I may see the changes to the delivery points.
205	Thanks, Mike
206	Frank Ermis claims that this deal was priced at Index.
206	He was the Trader on this deal.
206	Please call him to discuss.
206	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
207	Anne, can you look at this deal and check to see how it was priced?
208	Ken called yesterday and we bought 5000/d april from him at 4.87.
208	He said it could be either Milagro or El Paso SJ.
208	Please call him and confirm the receipt point.
208	Thanks, Mike
209	Anne, We will need to add a message to the email that we send out to the publications this bidweek.
209	Let's get together to discuss the text.
209	We have added new products that will need to be matched with their respective Index postings.
209	Thanks, Mike
210	The information is correct.
210	Please settle with the customer.
210	Thanks, Mike
211	The Rockies index language looks good.
211	We need to separate the southern border PG&E trades from the southern border socal and Socal trades.
211	All Socal trades (except KRS, which we have none at this time) go under Socal and trades go under the Southern border, PG&E wacog.
211	Please make the change to the sheet and forward a copy to me before emailing.
211	Thanks, Mike
212	Please write up a ticket transferring my CIG and WIC April physical positions to IM denver.
212	I will be selling CIG index to Jay at CIG index flat and buying the 2000/d at CIG index minus .03.
212	Also, run a report of all my term index positions at CIG and WIC for the summer, so that we can transfer these to Jay as well.
212	Thanks, Mike
213	Jay, what are we doing with questar positions?
213	Are you managing this index point?
213	I have an April position and Mark Whitt is working on a term deal.
213	Thanks, Mike
214	Anne, Can we add PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock index points to the NCD locations?
214	I think we discussed that they can't be added because of their association with Socal curves.
214	Let me know.
214	Also, can we add the new rockies index locations to the NCD sheet?
214	It would be nice to see these locations broken out in detail.
214	Mike
215	We now have a PG&E topock basis product on EOL.
215	The curve is currenlty mapped to Socal with the differential to Socal being calculated in the physical index curve.
215	Let's work on setting up this curve on Tuesday so that it shows the accurate value for fin deals.
215	We can have the curve calc off of a discount to citygate in Keith's spreadsheet.
215	Mike
216	Please call me.
216	I believe I ordered a bloomberg machine only.
216	Does it some with its own operating system or is it offered through the network?
216	Please let me know before coming to install.
216	I already have two computers.
216	Thanks, Mike
217	We need to talk about the contract language for Holly Sugar.
217	Please see Kim Ward about some of the language we have used for full-req customers on PG&E.
217	Thanks, Mike
218	Anne, What was this converation about?
218	Let me know what they wanted.
218	Thanks, Mike
219	Please sign me up for the new parking garage.
219	Thank you, Mike Grigsby
220	Please include me on this trip.
220	Have Ina reserve a plane flight for us if you don't mind.
220	Thanks, Mike
221	I will use this pc for bloomberg only.
221	I already have two pcs.
221	One for normal networking and one for EOL.
221	My login is mgrigsb and my password is mike0coco.
221	My lotus notes password is mike2coco.
221	Please feel free to install the pc and monitors on Thursday or Friday.
221	Thanks, Mike
222	Yes, Please forward me the login and password again.
222	I would like to be included in Enron's corporate wide license.
222	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
223	Anne, can we add the new pg&e topock curve to the basis transport tab?
223	Also, the LT transport section is showing the transport positions through 2002, which is incorrect.
223	Please review the transport deals in the model and delete the positions.
223	Thanks, Mike
224	Anne, it looks like the socal position for socal is incorrect.
224	The position looks much smaller than it did today.
224	Please check to see if Patti made changes to deals in sitara.
224	Mike Grigsby
225	THANK YOU.
226	Thanks.
226	I don't think that there should be a fin gd swap position of 12 lots in the mojave index column.
226	Please check to see how the deal was booked.
226	Thanks, Mike
227	That was the main factor.
227	The cash market also had a difficult time trading higher than 14.50.
227	The basis curve was on its way to contango, when it has lived in backwardation for some time.
227	This created resistance on the basis curve.
227	The PG&E announcement pushed it over the edge.
227	Market is back up today on stronger cash and the socal edison announcement.
227	Mike
228	I will be coming back on this flight.
228	Please disregard my request to go directly to Las Vegas.
228	I will need a flight to Las Vegas on the following Friday and returning Sunday morning.
228	Thanks, Mike
229	Monday at 11:30 would be great.
229	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
230	Please make the return on Sunday earlier.
230	Before 12:00 would be great.
230	Thanks, Mike
231	Anne, I would like to check the index positions in the physindex tab in NCD.
231	Please have all of the positions in the BasisTransport tab, section transport model, added to the phys index position totals.
231	Please look at the PG&E CG positions for May-Oct, I added the transport positions already.
231	I would like to add a KRS row in the physindex summary to account for the 20000/d transport that we have.
231	Also, please have the new transport index positions at Socal that we are booking tomorrow included in the new KRS column in the physindex tab.
231	We can review in the afternoon.
231	You are doing a great job.
231	I am sorry that I have not had a chance to thank you recently.
231	The market is distracting me.
231	Sincerely, Mike
232	Mo, Are your reports still available for EOL that you created months ago?
232	I would like to turn them over to the fundies group ( Matt Smith) tomorrow.
232	Mike
233	Anne, After NX1 going forward, I would like to load my final positions in the LIQBasis tab in NCD.
233	The positions will include basis, physindex and gd index positions.
233	We can then run settlement index scenarios to see what my risk will be to index postings.
233	This will be a huge benefit.
233	Mike
234	Thanks.
234	It looks like the phys transport volumes were added to socal and citygate, but could you add all of the transport model positions to the Mike
235	Nice compliment.
235	We shoudl discuss putting together an automated sheet each day for cash trading.
235	Please get together with me and the fundies group to work out a report.
235	Thanks, Mike
236	I will volunteer for interviewing candidates.
236	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
237	Thank you for the summary.
237	Where can we find a detailed summary of the gas cost mechanism?
237	Are we confident that it is an average of all border points into CA?
237	If the real time price is capped at the least efficient generator, then what happens if this genertor can only buy Socal daily gas?
237	This avergae CA gas price will lead to a tighter heat rate for the generators, since the spread between Malin and Socal has reached $7.00 at times.
237	Thank you, Mike Grigsby
238	What was the 10 million diff?
238	Physical book?
238	Thanks, Mike
239	The proxy price will be Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald for Ca deliveries.
239	How do we submit prices to Cantor Fitzgerald?
239	Anne, we will need to come up with a cash report, much like our monthly index report for the publications.
239	Our data submitted will be under scrutiny at some point in the future.
239	It is important that all of our cash (one day) deals are reported accurately each day.
239	Thanks, Mike
240	You all have done an excellent job with the gas daily products.
240	I have been asked to follow up with you guys to ensure that the products are rolled out on EOL at the same time each day and that they be managed in the same manner that you manage your cash products each day.
240	We have been asked to have one a day up at all times with a relatively tight two way and to provide market depth.
240	You may provide market depth, offset to last trade, or use last trade mid functions.
240	Let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding this request.
240	Thanks, Mike
241	Cantor Fitzgerald will be used along with Gas Daily for CA gas prices under the Ferc proxy price.
241	Are you guys familiar with Cantor's pricing publication?
241	How do we submit prices to these guys?
241	Let me know if you have any idea.
241	Thanks, Mike
242	Good morning.
242	I am going to unavailable for the interviews on Monday.
242	The continued Califonia energy crisis and Enron's gas positions will not allow me to leave the desk on Monday.
242	I apologize for the inconvenience, but my time must be spent in the office.
242	Please let me know how I may be able to assist the interview process in the future.
242	I am always willing to help out when I have the time.
242	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
243	Looks great!
244	I sent an email to Phillip as well.
244	We will find out.
245	Our associates on the desk have asked why they have been included in the associate evaluation.
245	Are they in the corporate associate pool or are they simply designated associates on the trading floor?
245	No big deal - just forwarding their comments.
245	Mike
246	Phillip, Courtney needs me to watch the boys on Thursday in order to get organized before we leave for Italy.
246	I can be reached on my cell phone 713-408-6256.
246	Please have Anne update the newcurrentday sheet in order to manage my position.
246	Please call me with any pertinent market information.
246	I will see you Friday.
246	Thanks for the help.
246	Thanks, Mike
247	We need to make certain that the transport for Pasdena is booked properly in sitara.
247	I am taking a flash to actual hit on P&L because of our inability to book this deal properly.
247	I need the transport booked in sitara at index to index, and then book the fixed cost payed to Pasadena in an index minus sale to them at the border.
247	Please run a minibook of the transaction thru the remaining term and let me review it.
247	Please let me know when this has been fixed.
247	Kim, what is the cost of the transport for the month of May?
247	Did we roll the cost from April?
247	Also, did we change the index in the San Juan to Inside Thanks, Mike
248	Craig, Did you ever follow up with Kim Ward and the desk on the contract language for the deal or deals you did with CA endusers?
248	We need to make certian that the customers are signed to the correct contract for balancing, etc. Please get with me to discuss.
248	Mike Grigsby
249	We need to run regression on this load profile for Palo Alto.
249	We should back out the industrial class and run their residential load.
249	Can you find reliable weather for Palo Alto?
249	Kim Ward is signing a full requirements deal with Palo on PG&E.
249	Thanks, Mike
250	Will you schedule him for an hour each with Phillip and I and 30 minutes with the other guys.
250	Thanks.
251	Ryan, Please run the report each day at 3:00 and email to the group.
251	Set up a distribution with the following names: mike grigsby stephanie miller mark whitt matt smith matt lenhart tori kuykendall steve south randy gay jay reitmeyer eric bass tom martin matt motley (portland) Thanks, Mike
252	Randy, Will you please get together with Jason and discuss the daily report.
252	Randy is working with the Sitara group to generate a report which will include all trades, EOL and non-EOL trades.
252	This report will give us a complete analysis of the cash activity.
252	Thanks, Mike
253	The overview last week was great.
253	Are you going to have Phil put together a graph of all expansions?
253	That would be a nice visual for the desk.
253	Thanks, Mike
254	I am thinking that I will make the Socal markets going forward.
254	I will roll out the Nov-Mar and Apr-Oct.
254	Do you want to handle the internal flow with mid market?
254	Let me know what your thoughts are in regards to making longer term markets on EOL.
254	Mike
255	Thanks.
255	Will you add West to the report title.
255	West Natural Gas Prices.
255	Nice work
256	Please call her and let her know that I cancelled my Bloomberg a few weeks ago.
256	Have her confirm it via email.
256	Thanks, Mike
257	If you guys would like this sheet as well, then send an email to Amy Felling.
257	Mike
258	Thank you for the information.
259	John, Monique Sanchez submitted her resignation this afternoon.
259	She is moving to Salt Lake City with her fianc?
259	and will not be working in the industry.
259	I moved all of her positions to my book today.
259	We have cancelled her EOL trading rights and her stack manager ID.
259	She will be managing the Permian cash position on EOL for my book, much like Matt and Jason are doing right now.
259	We have asked her to stay until October 12 so that she may complete her SJ/PERM production and work on west fundamentals.
259	Please let me know if you have any problems with this arrangement.
259	Mike
260	Monique has resigned and will be leaving October 12.
260	Please take one of her monitors and give it to Mog.

265	Thanks for all of your hard work.
265	Mike
266	Thanks.
266	Can I email this in the morning?
267	Would you like to sit down with a group of traders from the west gas desk?
267	Should you bring along the guy who sent us the coal plants, Aaron Martinsen?
267	Tomorrow afternoon around 2:30.

274	Thank you for the offer.
274	Courtney and I are going to the TX/OU game.
275	Thank you for the resume.
275	I will forward this to our Operations group for the western region.
275	I think his experience would be a good fit for our logistics group.
275	I will have you call Patti Sullivan.
275	Thank you, Mike Grigsby
276	Trust, starring Keith Holst, rated PG.
277	Palo file.
277	Winter is approaching.
277	You are the King.
278	How is this issue?
279	Hello.
279	It is actually Ryan O'Rouke, #17.
279	Thanks, Mike
280	Is Keith setting this up?
280	Should we do this first thing at the Wed fundies meeting?
280	Let me know.
280	Thanks, Mike
281	I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.
281	We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.
281	I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.
281	What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.
281	Is it as simple as gathering and processing?
281	Let me know your thoughts.
281	Thanks,
282	Are we going to cover the western Canada fundamentals presentation and the X tomorrow?
282	Please send Keith an email so that we may set an agenda.
282	Thanks, Mike
283	How is it being monitored by Big brother?
284	How is the project coming along?
284	No rush, just wanted to check in. Thanks, Mike
285	Ina, can I get a copy of the seating chart?
285	Thanks, Mike
286	Please define close?
286	Also, what is the outstanding issue with Redwood?
286	Please set up another meeting with a copy of the actual flows to Palo, sales prices, third party deals and an example of an invoice.
286	I would like to walk through the deal.
286	Thanks, Mike
287	Will you please add the prices for the power and add a key showing the variable rates and the O&M used for calculating the spark spread?
287	Nice job.
287	Thank you for publishing this each day.
287	Thanks, Mike P.S.
287	I nominated you to interview for the Trading Track.
287	It is your option.
288	My fault for forwarding the email without reviewing.
288	I apologize.
288	I have asked Kim Ward to send me the complete file.
288	Thanks, Mike
289	The file actually does include all of the data.
289	Just scroll to the left when you open it.
289	Thanks, Mike
290	History of Series Texas, 55-35-5.
290	Last 20 years, Texas 11-7-2.
290	Enjoy the game.
291	This is true.
291	They will not tell us for how long, but they did shut-in 45,000/d.
292	Please send me an email list of all of our west traders and their work numbers.
292	Thanks, Mike
293	Tom, Please review and let me know if this helps.
293	If it works, then please forward to other interested parties on your desk.
293	Thanks, Mike
294	I think this may be final.
294	Mike
295	I have added two spots on the desk for logistics.
295	I thought it would be best to have one rep for the Rockies, Stacy Brewer and one for the Southwest, Shannon Groenewald.
295	It would be nice to have Patti on the floor, but it would be like taking the teacher from the classroom.
295	Let me know what you think.
295	Mike
296	Ina, Will you please have an HR rep handle communications with Jim Hemmerly and his executive search firm, Michael Hubley (number listed below).
296	Don Black and I are interested in talking with him further and would like to communicate through HR.
296	Please let me know when they have been contacted.
296	Thanks, Mike
297	Thank you.
297	Would this report be real time?
297	Stop by when you get a chance.
297	Mike
298	That is fine.
298	Please give Monique's phone and box to Matt Smith as well.
298	I am not sure which pc to give Matt Smith, flip a coin.
299	Okay.
299	I will reserve them for you, but with the understanding that they are for Trading growth and can disappear at any time.
299	Thanks, Mike
300	Today at 3:00?
300	Let me know.
300	Mike
301	Okay.
302	We will meet for thirty minutes before our 3:30 fundies meeting.
302	1.
302	EOL market making - Lavo has asked us to increase basis liquidity.
302	Janie has mentioned general theme of market, "why trade on EOL 5000/d and risk moving the market".
302	We are becoming market framers.
302	I think Frank Ermis is a pioneer.
302	2.
302	Deal confirmations - Anne Bike misbooked a deal for me from March, cost $3.5 million.
302	How do we deal with this issue of confirmations missing deals.
302	3.
302	Vacation and work hours - Discuss vacation schedules for the rest of the year.
302	We need to do a good job of coordinating when we are out.
302	Mike
303	Happy Birthday Rice.
303	Grigs
304	Sure.
304	12:15?
305	Yes.
305	I need a new keyboard.
305	Thanks, Mike
306	Can you wait until 1:20?
307	Nice work
308	these attachments do not work.
309	I would like to set up a spreadsheet to enter each deal that I transact, internal and external.
309	I would then like columns set up that allow Monte to enter post ids for all hedge strips for prior day and new day.
309	We should then sum the net change of the two and balance against the columns summing the new deals that I enter each day.
309	This method should give us another way of checking if all new deals are being booked properly.
309	Please meet with Keith Holst to discuss how to set up the sheet.
309	He has a similar process of checkking new deals.
309	Once this is set up, please have each bookrunner adopt the same prcatice with their trader.
309	I would like Anne to be responsible for seeing that this new process is in place for next week's business.
309	I understand that the standard for most deals is 5000/d and that this can lead to booking 50000/d at this volume.
309	We need to have Anne set up a trader deal sheet that lists the volume and price in a clear and legible format for all bookrunners.
309	Thanks, Mike
310	I would like to set up a brief meeting in the afternoon this week or next, to discuss increasing the liquidity in west basis on EOL.
310	It would be helpful for our desk to sit down with John Arnold and John Lavorato to openly discuss the importance of continuing to increase liquidity on EOL.
310	I would also like to put to rest the notion that increasing liquidity leads to negative P&L and that a Trader's support of EOL liquidity will go unrecognized at year end PRC.
310	Please email me with a response of when we could set up such a meeting.
310	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
311	Should we reschedule when Scott Neal is available?
312	I love the "club" quote, because they really are.
312	It is a good old boy network that colludes against every day and every month.
312	In this case, the "club" is Reliant, Williams, Duke and others who own TW transport to SJ from Ignacio.
312	Our TW transport expires in Dec, so for Enron to bid firm 100% flow in the SJ, we have to price it at a discount because of the cuts through Bondad on El Paso.
312	We could bid higher if it was average flows or we had TW firm transport.
313	Don, I remember him as being a passive guy.
313	He is very conservative, level headed, and fairly organized.
313	I would test his ability to handle new businesses and stress.
313	By the way, he worked at Coastal when I was there.
313	Mike
314	Texaco has short paid us by 1.5 million for Socal cuts.
314	I believe that they claimed a penalty on the net out for the amount.
314	We do not agree with this short pay and stand by the description of the Socal product in which it states that there will be cuts due to operational constraints on the upstream pipelines.
314	I would like to return the short pay favor to Texaco.
314	Please let me know how we should proceed.
314	Mike Grigsby
315	We have decided not to pursue Jim.
315	Do I need to contact HR?
315	Please let me know.
315	Mike
316	Please notify HR that we will not be pursuing Jim.
316	Have them call his executive search rep as well.
316	Thanks, Mike
317	Only EOL market makers are allowed to use free loading brokers.
317	Please do not use brokers for markets outside of your market making responsibility.
317	I am going to have the back office decline to book all broker deals done by traders outside of their responsibility.
317	Thanks, Mike
318	Please begin your focus on increasing EOL liquidity as soon as possible.
318	This is not a long term project.
318	Lavo will be seeking immediate results.
318	Thanks, Mike
319	thanks
320	Please move the box from Janie's desk to Randy's desk as soon as possible.
320	You will not need Janie's approval.
320	Thanks, Mike
321	I would like it done on Monday.
321	Please.
321	Thanks
322	Sure.
322	How is 2:30?
322	Feel free to stop by and we can grab a conference room.
323	We were wondering why Frank Ermis is scheduled for the Trading Track interviews.
323	Is this correct?
323	Also, am I not on the list for interviews?
323	Please let us know.
323	Thank you, Mike Grigsby
324	Okay.
324	We were referring to the phone interview folders that were passed out.
324	Frank asked me to verify.
324	Thank you
325	Thanks for the update.
325	Will fundies be able to put together a project list on the website?
325	Thanks, Mike
326	Barry, I would rather not get into the habit of locking in curves before the deal is officially closed (signed).
326	Can we just agree on a sharing policy, so that we may avoid the event underlined below.
326	I would like to consider the curves floating until it is booked.
326	We are all sharing the risk of Huber not signing.
326	Thanks, Mike
327	How is the project coming?
327	Would you like to get involved in the west fundies projects as well?
327	I would like you stay involved, so let me know how I can help to include you more.
327	Mike
328	Please look at two supply deals with Enserco at the Citygate for March 2001.
328	Nov-Mar deal, number 396352, at 11.27 and a March only deal, number 63338(?), at 10.59.
328	They are contesting the fact that we allocated all cuts to the highest priced deal.
328	Cost $72000.
328	Please take a look at these deals and the cuts and let me know if we should agree to their argument and reallocate 50/50.
328	Thanks, Mike
329	Are we almost done with a master customer contact sheet?
329	Let me know how Steve and Janie can help you with this.
329	When finished, please forward to all traders.
329	Thanks, Mike
330	Will you please activate all phys and fin index products for Nov and Nov-Mar.
330	Don't forget to paint it with nice tight two ways and wood.
330	Thanks for playing, Mike
331	Please activate product number 45313.
331	Thank you, Mike
332	And number 58266.
332	thanks
333	Ina, My new address is 3011 Reba Drive, 77019.
333	Phone number 713-528-1141.
333	We can worry about this on the next West Desk update.
333	Thanks, Mike
334	Thank you for helping on the other two.
334	Please activate the following long list of products: Thanks, Mike
335	Did we rebook the orig for the reduced volumes?
335	Please send me the rebooked volumes.
335	Thanks, Mike
336	Hello.
336	We would like the ability to trade cash with Puget Sound.
336	It is very difficult to interrupt the business and information that we receive from serving Puget as we near the winter months.
336	If you need to freeze business to evaluate the impact of the recent ruling, then please freeze baseload business only.
336	In the future, please call me with any credit issues in the west.
336	Phillip Allen is no longer the Desk Director of the west.
336	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
337	thank you
338	Just want to check on the variable rate spreadsheet that you are working on.
338	Also, can you please change the Keystone page in the west packet to show total supply in the Permian basin with all delivery points to exporting pipelines (EPNG, Northern, Valero, TW).
338	Right now it just shows receipts into EPNG.
338	Please look at the attached spreadsheet.
338	It is a manual sheet that shows total EOL trades by trader.
338	Can we automate this sheet so that we can monitor by day?
338	Please respond when you get a chance.
338	Let me know if this is unclear.
338	Thanks, Mike
339	Please trade smaller in the future.
339	You are doing a great job making the markets PG&E and Malin, but your positions are getting too large.
339	Do not stop yourself out today in one move, but rather begin a methodical plan to reduce your risk.
339	Make a move to get closer to your VAR.
339	You are the King.
340	Hunter asked me to fill in for him yesterday because he was out of the office.
340	I had an emergency and could not call the list.
340	Please let me know how to proceed.
340	Would you like me to call them today.
340	Thanks, Mike
341	Please have some one sleep in the office until this spreadsheet is completed.
341	Thanks, Mike
342	Thank you.
343	Casually let Kim know that Phillip Allen no longer is in charge of the west.
343	No big deal, I just heard her tell the SMUD guys that Phillip runs the desk, etc. Grigs
344	Feel free to call Randy Gay and Frank Ermis for Gas Dailies.
344	I do not have a broker box.
344	I simply make the markets for CA online.
344	Thanks, Mike
345	We will be implementing an additional confirm process going forward.
345	All broker deals will be booked by Risk and placed in TAGG to generate a confirmation.
345	Before the confirmation is sent to the counterparty, the Enron trader will sign off on the confirm.
345	All broker deals will be handled this way.
345	Please generate a new daily summary report of all broker deals by trader in the west region.
345	This will allow me to verify if the new process is being handled properly.
345	Anne, please communicate this to your group.
345	Thanks, Mike
346	thank you
347	Can you check on the progress of the pipe expansion graph.
347	Thanks, Mike
348	thank you
349	Please see the attached chart outlining our Confirmation process.
349	This is the same process that Barry Tycholiz implemented for Origination.
349	I think it is a great way to verify our booking process.
349	Please use the trading books that Anne Bike passed out yesterday.
349	Thanks, Mike
350	Keith and I discussed working towards this meeting being organized every week.
350	We would like the meeting to begin at 3:00 and to have all interested parties (Canada and Portland) dialed in to AT&T.
350	I would like the meeting room cleared and the handouts to be emailed before the meeting begins.
350	Please work towards emailing everyone an itinerary each week.
350	You guys are making great progress with the fundies information.
350	Nice work.
350	Thanks, Mike
351	That is fine.
351	Just please coordinate the format with Keith.
351	Thanks
352	until 4:30
353	I will forward this to HR.
353	By the way, no one gets an MBA to be an energy broker.
353	Tell him to focus on trading.
353	I might be too busy to meet with him next week.
353	Have him go by and spend the day with Knauth.
354	Please see attached description.
354	This is going to be a new product.
354	Please call it US Gas Phys Kern Las Vegas.
354	Thanks, Mike
355	I was just talking schmack.
356	Where do we stand with our systems being capable of booking physical fixed priced deals on EOL?
356	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
357	My position in NCD is not matching the reports issued to Lavo.
357	Monte is showing 233 lots long intra and the report is showing 413.
357	See if you can find the difference.
357	Thanks, Mike
358	Thank you.
358	Please let me know if you have any questions.
358	Thanks, Mike
359	The Broker report looks incorrect to me.
359	Please stop by and we can go over some of the trades.
359	Thanks, Mike
360	I talked to Fernando Leija and Randy Hebert.
360	I would like to recommend both of them for the Trading Track interviews.
360	Please call both of them to confirm the interview date.
360	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
361	The Intra month position total in NCD is not matching the total intra position on the reports going to Lavo and deskheads each morning.
361	Please reconcile.
361	Mike
362	Franky, Please delegate this project and any others to someone else.
362	Let me know who will be working on these projects while you are away.
362	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
363	Thanks for the update.
363	Please find a human being capable of taking on this project.
363	If you can't find one, then let Gaskill know.
363	You are the King
364	Thanks.
364	He just stopped by my desk and discussed passing this on to someone else.
364	Mike
365	Have we rebooked these volumes?
365	Let me know by Thursday or I will mark them down myself.
365	Thanks, Mike
366	Jeff, How should proceed with Texaco and their 1.5 million withholding?
366	Thanks, Mike
367	I would like Pablo to come to my house and help with my pc.
367	Mike
368	Let me know if you guys have come up with a value for the PG&E flex deal.
368	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
369	Dear West, We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.
369	If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.
369	Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.
369	We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.
369	We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.
369	Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.
369	Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.
369	Sincerely, Mike
370	Is Daniel Lisk not participating?
371	Thanks for the summary.
372	Let me know when you would like to discuss.
373	Thanks for the work.
374	Thank you for the update.
374	Mike Grigsby
375	Please proceed with number one.
375	They withheld the money related to operational cuts in the west.
375	Please contact Accounting for Texaco's exact description of the penalty and I will have Patti Sullivan contact you with the details from our perspective.
375	Mike
376	Please contact Jeff Hodge with the details of the cuts.
376	He needs the details to make the best case for Enron.
376	Please email your response to me before talking to Jeff.
376	Thanks, Mike
377	Please add him to the list.
377	His manager made a mistake.
377	Thanks, Mike
378	Please review summary organization.
379	We have Elizabeth Shim working on a new project.
379	We let her know that she will be moving into an analyst role for us in two weeks.
379	I asked her to give you her full focus for the remaining two weeks.
379	Thanks, Mike
380	You are on the list to interview.
380	Nov 1
381	Ryan has done a great job creating and maintaining the basis pricing sheet.
381	I would like you guys to add two more tabs to the file.
381	Please add a physical and finacial index pricing sheet with the same format.
381	We may need to create a more elaborate fin index curve file to accomodate this file.
381	Please show me the fin index curve file tomorrow so that we may update.
381	Let me know what you think.
381	Thanks, Mike
382	Sure.
382	Come by my desk after cash.
383	Changed just a few minor things in the summary.
383	Please look at the titles and arrangement of the positions in the summary.
383	Thanks, Mike
384	It sounds like you do not trust her work, so we should just cut bait and move her into fundies.
384	Let me know if you really need her for weekends.
385	Do we have a contract with MGI?
385	Mike
386	I do not have access to this file.
386	I requested access to the curves directory.
386	Do I need specific access to the file?
386	Thanks, Mike
387	We are looking at this.
387	Thanks, Mike
388	Your west desk cut us on the revised flex volumes of 30000 - none of it flowed.
388	I am confident they will have an excuse, but they have to know what their market is before final noms.
388	We need to do something to protect our reputation in the west.
388	The west is difficult enough to schedule when you are selecting your counterparties, but with EOL, we have become the physical "CUT Clearinghouse" in the west.
388	Any internal nom errors just make it more difficult to transact reliably on EOL.
388	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
389	Thank you.
390	We are including this language in our nightly bidweek summary to IFERC.
391	I am having trouble dialing your number.
391	I spoke to Randy Bhatia and he recommended you with confidence.
391	After reviewing your resume I would like to go ahead and recommend that you come to the interview process in November.
391	Please call me at work when you get a chance, 713-853-7031.
391	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
392	Please invite him to come to the interview.
392	I have talked to people that he worked with and they highly recommend him.
392	I sent him an email and asked him to call me when he gets a chance.
392	I had trouble dialing his number.
392	Thanks, Mike
393	Thank you.
393	I forwarded your resume to Keith Holst.
393	Please fell free to contact him.
393	Thanks, Mike
394	That sounds fine.
395	Any feedback from your group on dropping the nom?
395	Thanks, Mike
396	Temp file until the IT group completes the Internet version.
397	My wife is in New York and will not return until 4:40 on Sunday.
397	I am keeping my boys and will work on getting a babysitter in the morning.
397	I will call you tomorrow.
398	I will be there.
399	Thank you.
399	Will you please convert the positions to contracts.
399	Mike
400	Are you going to include the index position summary in this file?
400	Thanks, Mike
401	Is everyone getting this report daily?
401	Please review the file and let Anne know if you would like to modify the query.
401	Mike
402	SURE
403	Our group has been selling NOV to hedge our short basis position.
403	Our phys fixed priced liquidity this morning put us in a longer nov nymex position.
403	We have sold 872 since 11:00 am.
404	Sounds good.
404	My number is 713-853-7031.
404	I will call you.
405	I would like you to activate the following products: The location description during the copy process on the following products gave me problems.
405	Please create DEC 01 - Mar 02 products from these N0V-MAR product numbers: Thanks!

406	Please begin sending the P&L summary for the desk to this email.
406	Please tell Randy.
406	Thanks, Mike
407	Are these positions correct?
407	Please check the formulas for DEC-MAR.
407	The day on day change looks to large.
407	Let me know.
407	Thanks, Mike
408	Jeff said that he spoke to you.
408	I requested that they restate P&L for yesterday.
408	One issue is that I set the GD Index curves and Phys Index curves as usual, but Anne failed to pull in Index.
408	She pulled in only price and basis.
408	She will fix this going forward.
408	Reitmeyer's P&L was an issue with Logistics.
408	His transport tickets were not put in until 4:00 yesterday - too late to capture.
408	We will talk to Superty about this.
408	His P&L will be -610,000, a 1.3 million increase.
408	Frank Ermis is still looking into his issues.
408	I will call you after cash trading.
408	Mike
409	Wed will be spent trick or treating.
409	Let me know how long you will be in town?
410	Thank you.
410	Phillip Allen sits right behind me and he let me know that he was going to contact you.
410	We will see you in Houston.
410	Mike Grigsby
411	Thank you.
411	Let me know when you are done.
411	Mike
412	CAN WE RUN THIS FILE EVERY NIGHT?
412	ARE THE POSITIONS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE OR THE COUNTERPARTY'S?
412	THANKS!
413	Will you please update the yesterday column.
413	We should have restated the P&L from yesterday.
413	Thanks, Mike
414	The positions still look incorrect.
414	Take a look at the total Malin for Dec-Mar.
414	Also, please include all NOV intra month positions, change the prompt month to Dec, and change the Winter to Q1 Jan - Mar. Please forward a new copy after you make the changes.
414	Thanks, Mike
415	Same thing goes for this sheet.
415	Please move Nov to intra, Dec to prompt, etc. No need to republish this sheet this morning.
415	Thanks, Mike
416	Sounds good.
416	Will you give us a speech when we go over?
416	Topic how?
417	Where do we stand with Texaco?
417	This attachment details cuts by Texaco at PG&E Topock.
417	We would like to use this as a potential offset to their penalties in the event they do not waive their 1.5 million charge.
417	Mike
418	The P&L was stated incorrectly again.
418	The new numbers just went out.
418	We were down 3.7 million on the day, most of that coming from the transport book that falls next to Phillip's name.
418	We clearly have issues with our book runners.
418	Gossett is trying to fix it, but the surprises keep coming.
418	Let's set up a time to discuss the desk.
418	Mike
419	Thank you.
420	Let's get together tomorrow to discuss the west.
420	How is 2:00?
420	Mike
421	Nice work.
421	Can you add Jason Wolfe to the next report.
421	Thanks, Mike
422	Is this resolved?
422	Let me know.
422	Thanks, Mike
423	Will you change the dates of the column headings for the summary section.
423	Thanks, Mike
424	Please add me to this distribution list so I will not miss any move updates.
424	Thanks, Mike
425	As you know, we have a new book runner for the west.
425	I have asked Kam Keiser to go ahead and set up two new books for you guys.
425	Matt's book will be IM WC Socal, and Jason's will be IM WC Nocal.
425	These books will be ready for when we move into the new building.
425	I will transfer any positions that I have to you guys at gas daily mid.
425	You will make the markets for your own books.
425	We will address having you guys take the gas dailies in the near future.
425	Congratulations!
425	Mike
426	What is an additional offer?
426	Are they in the trading track program?
427	What is the latest and greatest on this project?
427	Mike
428	Ina could not get us into the new building tomorrow, so we will not get together after work.
428	We will plan on going out as a group after we move over.
428	Mike
429	Sure.
429	I would like to see your group participate in all of our meetings.
429	3:30 every day, tues power fundies, and 3:00 wed gas fundies .
429	Morning meetings would help you guys as well.
430	I would like to put a request in for Brent Dornier as well.
430	We think Jason Huang should move on to another rotation.
430	He has served the west as an Analyst and believe that he should get experience on another desk.
430	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
431	3209b - my desk.
432	You and Keith should try and get together this afternoon for thirty minutes.
432	Let me know.
432	Mike

440	Then have the bottom total row sum all of the positions.
440	Thanks, Mike

443	Mirant (They are clicking to reduce positions and exposure)
444	Keith Holst, from our west desk, met with Brent Dornier last week in London and Brent mentioned that he might be interested in joining the west gas trading desk.
444	We would like try and get him for his first Trading Track rotation.
444	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
445	Chris, We would like to claim Brent Dornier for the west when he begins his Trading Track rotation.
445	What are your thoughts?
446	Thank you.
447	Will show me how to get this sheet running?
447	Drop by when you get a chance.
447	Thanks
448	Can we delete the inactive books listed in the drop down box in TDS?
448	Also, can we set up another selection that includes all books less Phillip Allen's.
448	Thanks, Mike
449	Last week it would have been two cents, but now that there is a huge credit spread in the market, it may cost them .07.
449	We simply can't buy the physical volumes right now.
449	The credit spread in the SJ to cover our short is costing us .20.
449	I love this market.
450	This place gets better and better every day.
450	A piece of fiction.
451	NO
452	We will be limiting the attendee list for the Wed fundies meetings.
452	If you received this email then consider yourself invited.
452	Please let the schedulers know that only Patti will be attending in the future.
452	This is due to available space in the conference rooms.
452	Thanks, Mike
453	Will you please send me a complete list of all of our west schedulers and their pipe responsibilities?
453	I want to set up a mentor program with the traders.
453	Talk about it later.
453	Thanks, Mike
454	Good stuff.
454	Get me on the distribution list.
454	Mike
455	Janie Tholt called Dynegy because of the .12 cent spread between SJ EOL and SJ ICE.
455	The Trader at Dynegy said that they were busy training two schedulers to trade cash, and that arbing the market was not the message they wanted to send to them.
455	They would like to focus on the "Big Picture" instead.
455	We tried.
456	Please review.
456	I will talk to her today.
456	Thanks, Mike
457	We need to protect the flows to Citizens on TW.
457	I know you guys have been working on this, but Citizens continues to receive cuts.
457	Please secure the supply off of TW.
457	Let Sempra know that IB Link gas will not do.
457	Thanks, Mike
458	Let's get together after lunch tomorrow to discuss how to handle the books next month.
458	Cash and transfers from me to you.
458	Mike

462	I am sorry.
462	I have not had a chance to speak to Elizabeth.
462	I will let you know.
462	Thanks, Mike
463	There are rumors circulating that the Associate/Analyst program will be reduced soon.
463	Can we address this issue with some of the Associate/Analyst employees on the floor?
463	Will Associates be reduced regardless of whether or not they are in a core business, etc.?
463	Let me know if I can address this with some of our people.
463	Mike
464	Let's not forget the fact that Citizens has cut Enron more during the life of the deal.
464	The only company walking away from a deal will be Enron.
464	We will set up a meeting to discuss fixing the problem.
464	Thanks, Mike
465	We have conference room 6716 from 3:00 to 4:00 each day for OPS.
465	I have not inspected the room to see if it will accommodate our entire group.
465	Thanks, Mike
466	Can you include the desk to desk summary in this email each day?
466	The title of the report is Enorn North America Corp. (Deal Detail Listing Counterparty).
466	It lists all desk to desk trades by book.
466	Thanks, Mike
467	Please review this file every day.
467	Biliana will be posting this file on the web in the near future.
467	The summary includes all desk to desk deals.
467	Mike
468	Sounds good.
468	I would like Monte to prepare my estimate on newcurrentday first, submit it to you, then calc the book.
468	Is this okay?
468	Mike
469	What is this project?
470	Please look into this deal.
470	Thanks, Mike
471	Do you have a minute to discuss your role on the west desk?
471	Please come by my desk.
471	Mike
472	Jason Huang has already done his rotation in the west as an analyst.
472	Please move him into another rotation.
472	Thanks, Mike
473	I just spoke to Elizabeth.
473	I told her that we would move her out of Trading Track and in to the Analyst pool.
473	I also told her about setting a performance plan going forward and that you would be contacting her.
473	She knows that she will be working as an Analyst for the west.
473	I will complete the plan and forward to you.
473	Mike
474	Please take Matt Lenhart's var limit on the sheet to 2 million.
474	Thanks, Mike
475	Thank you.
476	Monte, Please scrub the prompt tab, phys index tab, fin index tab, and consolidated tab.
476	Make sure they all tie out to the hedge strips and sitara.
476	Shannon will give you a copy of my physical volumes from sitara.
476	We will go over it tomorrow.
476	Shannon, Please run a new copy of all DEC positions for IM WC CAL and give it to Monte Jones.
476	Thanks, Mike
477	We will hold off transferring any physical positions desk to desk until the end of bidweek.
477	After NX1, we will transfer positions at a daily EOL Index mid price.
477	Please monitor my book and others to make certain DEC deals are not being transferred prior to NX1 at an IF monthly or GD daily mid price.
477	Thanks, Mike
478	No problem.
479	My physical hedge strips are not matching sitara for San Juan and Permian.
479	Please check the positions for DEC and take a look at how all of the transport is booked.
479	Thanks, Mike
480	Let's go ahead and move it.
480	Thanks.
481	Have you solved the problem with the positions?
481	Let me know.
481	Mike
482	Was Elizabeth Shim on the list?
482	I can't remember.
482	Mike
483	Please place her at 60 or below.
483	She is under a performance review plan and has been removed from Trading Track.
483	Zack McCarroll started with the west desk two weeks ago.
483	Do we need to add him to the list?
483	Thanks, Mike
484	He came over from Broadband.
484	We think this guy is great.
484	We would like to rank him high enough to keep.
484	Try 40 and higher.
484	Thanks, Mike
485	The video says www.bloomberg.com.
485	We get the video source through an application called IP TV viewer.
485	I am not sure how Enron provides this service to us.
486	No classes available.
486	Mike
487	Has Phil found the supply for Mexicana?
488	In light of the current circumstances with the company and the concerns that our counterparties have at this time, I would like to leave the upstream business in Denver.
488	Moving this business would lead to confusion with our customers and to our Denver based employees.
488	Let me know if you have any issues with this.
488	If you would like to go up there for coordination and training, then feel free to travel to Denver.
488	Thanks,
489	Please make five copies of this report for the meeting.
489	Thanks
490	Patti Sullivan informed me that the Logistics group performed a PRC last week and ranked Elizabeth Shim to be fired from Enron.
490	I do not believe Elizabeth Shim is there employee to rank for termination.
490	Until last week, Elizabeth Shim was in the Trading Track program on loan to Bob Hall and logistics.
490	If they were trying to meet quota by terminating Elizabeth, then I think they need to look elsewhere.
490	The Trading group should be making the decision on whether or not we fire Trading Track employees.
490	We just put Elizabeth on a performance plan and ranked her in the Associate/Analyst PRC on Monday.
490	Let me know, Mike Grigsby
491	Go in and view the open positions.
491	We will discuss getting quotes in a few minutes.
491	Steve South will be coordinating our efforts to screen print ICE every 10 minutes.
492	Will you fax me the final rankings from the other day.
492	Did you get a chance to rank Zack McCarroll?
492	Please send it over when you get a chance.
492	Thanks, Mike
493	I am not sure how to approach this.
493	I appreciate your comments, but the ultimate decision will be made over the next few weeks.
493	If you would like to resign, then let me know.
493	Mike
494	Please update the email distribution list to include Kelley_Doolan@platts.com and mhenergy@yahoo.com.
494	Let's go ahead and send our usual format.
494	No changes to the sheet.
494	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
495	After the horns, NO!
495	How is it going?
495	Everything here is going okay.
495	The ENE story is behind us all.
495	Grigs
496	That is fine under the circumstances, but why were they sitting around for a few months without me knowing?
496	Thanks, Mike
497	Thank you for the email.
497	We are doing as well as we can after the Chris Simms debacle.
497	What a hack!
497	The ENE story is a good one.
497	Hunter and I will have you market the book, and your boy, Tate, will be the ghost writer.
497	We will see you soon.
498	Please give Zach McCarroll access to the network and reactivate his login and password.
498	Let me know why he was taken off the system.
498	Thanks, Mike Grigsby V.P., West Trading

499	He is moving from London and will be with the west gas trading desk as an Associate/Analyst - Trading Track.
499	Thanks, Mike
500	Can you email me with the details?
501	PLEASE REACTIVATE ZACH MCCARROLL FOR NETWORK ACCESS IMMEDIATELY.
501	THANKS, MIKE GRIGSBY VICE PRESIDENT, WEST GAS TRADING
502	Thank you so much.
502	No one is better than you.
502	You should teach a class.
502	Love you, Mike
503	I just faxed it to you.
503	Let me know.
503	Mike
504	No problem.
504	I am leaving town Sat and Sun.
504	Let me know what works for him.
504	Mike
505	Bob, After discussing the potential cuts with John, Randy Gay will remain as the only transfer to Logistics from my group.
505	I will have him run the group at that time.
505	Zachary McCarroll will be transferring to west risk from my group.
505	Thanks, Mike Grigsby
506	You want Zach in risk because he is better talent than what you currently have.
506	Patti will be noming a pipe and working for Randy.
507	Please move Donna off of the west desk logistics.
507	After discussing her experience with Randy and Don Black, I am choosing not to accept her on the west team.
507	Let me know if we need to move her to the 2 or 3 list.
507	Thanks, Mike
508	I do not see Monte on any of the three lists.
508	Will you pls check.
508	Mike
509	We put him in the West Orig team and he is being cut.
509	Tych will notify him today.
510	Are we making deliveries to this contract?
510	Please put together a cuts sheet for this deal.
510	Thanks, Mike
511	I do not know whether or not I will be in town.
511	Call me.
512	Patti Sullivan and Suzanne Christiansen informed me that all west deliveries have been kept whole.
512	Please contact them directly if you require detail on a daily basis.
512	They will be happy to assist you.
512	If you have any problems, please do not hesitate to call me at 713-853-7031.
512	Sincerely, Mike Grigsby
513	What is this for?
514	For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.
514	We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.
514	Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.
514	I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.
515	Will we be acting as agent for Pasadena in January?
515	Should we turn this contract back?
515	Let me know what your thoughts are.
515	Mike
516	Are we handling the PGT 75,000 of Malin deliveries in Jan just like we have in Dec?
516	Let us know.
516	Mike

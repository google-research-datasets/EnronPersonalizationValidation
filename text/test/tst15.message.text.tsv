4	I am at EOTT this morning.
4	Glad we early voted.
4	I think Bush has it and I don't think it will be that close.
4	Watch how Florida and Pennslylvania go.
4	If they go Bush; its over.
4	If Gore wins these two states he has a chance if he takes Michigan.
4	Key states are Florida, Pennslylvania,and Michigan.
4	I am still hoping for a last minute Nader rally.

11	He is a super person!!
11	This group has strong ties to ETS and creates a lot of value for us.
11	Good luck!!
12	There is not much noted in the finished column.
12	An explanation or revised finish date would be helpful.

12	Stan Horton

14	Stan
15	I am at EOTT this morning.
15	We released 3rd quarter earnings and have a analyst conference call.
15	We did pretty good.
15	Daddy
16	I will leave Houston around 10:30 tomorrow, so lunch should be around 1:30.
16	Then I am free for at least a couple of hours before I have to go to the Hyatt.
16	I will leave SA on Friday at noon if you want a ride home or if you want me to follow you.
16	I think however you leave earlier than that and thats ok.
16	I will be tied up the rest of the time there.
16	Love, Dad
17	Good news.
17	Congratulations and good luck.
18	I understand.
18	Thanks for the update.

21	I anm ready to resume play.
22	test
23	Shelly, we can do that but check with Cindy when she returns next week.
24	Sounds good.
24	give me a call when you return.
24	Happy Thanksgiving to all.
25	Unfortunately I cannot play on Sunday.
25	We will try the following weekend.
25	Thanks
26	Take it easy.
26	I tried to play last week at a company outing and can barely walk now.
26	It is hell getting old!!
26	Happy Thanksgiving.
27	I will attend in person.
27	Thanks
28	Lunch sounds great.
28	The question is when would be a good time.
28	Cindy is out this week but I will have her figure out a date.
29	My knee is killing me.
29	I am going to sue Dr. Frost!!
29	I just decided to go pretty easy on it for the next couple of weeks and see if it gets any better.
29	Talk with you tonight.
29	Bye the way Jessica is not doing well.
29	DK is taking her to the doctor today.
29	I will let you know how she is tonight.
29	Dad
30	Shelley, we need to make sure Mike knows of all the ramifications of this entire deal.
30	I have no problem with them pursuing a regulatory approach to the quality issue but a commercial decision would be better for all parties.
31	Looks ok to me.
32	I am glad things are working out for you.
33	Six lousy weeks away from me and you go do something like this.
33	Now it will no more golf because you will have too many "honey do's" to do.
33	Just kidding.
33	That is great news.
33	Congratulations.
33	I can't wait to meet her.
33	When is the wedding date?
34	I do not think I will be able to do the conference call tomorrow.
34	Could you call me on Monday with further information on our panel?
35	Good morning.
35	I am at EOTT today and then I will go into to town for a little while.
35	Jessica is no9t doing very well and neither I am I. Fell like I am coming down with something.
35	Talk with you later tonight.
35	Sorry I didn,t get to talk with you last night.
35	Both babies were real fussy and we had to work hard to get them down.
35	I did a pretty good job with Jason!
35	I look forward to you getting home for Turkey Day!
35	Dad
36	I recieved the same document.
36	If you would distribute it to the committee that would be appreciated.
36	I would think we might want to discuss it at the Board meeting prior to setting up another meeting with EEI.
36	What do you think?
36	I can see pros and cons of meeting with EEI prior to the next Board meeting.
36	Depending on the strawman I feel we are beginning to lose key support from the Board to work this matter.
36	Bill we need to get the Board to continue to follow him if we are to make progress.
37	Good morning.
37	Thanks for the yahoo greeting.
37	It made my day.
37	Have a great day.
37	Remember that Cathy and Carol's birthday is Nov. 30th.
37	I sent them a card and a $100 check to go out to dinner on us.
37	I signed it from all of us.
37	Hope you don't mind.
37	They would enjoy an email from you.
37	Love' Dad
38	Thanks for the strawman.
38	I would like to discuss it at our GISB Board meeting on December 7th.
38	Any problems with doing that?
38	We have distributed to the Board Committee only.
38	My initial reaction is there is alot we agree on but there is much we do not agree on.
38	Let me know about the Board meeting.
38	Also, this Board meeting will be my last as Chairman.
38	I do not know what role, if any, Bill Boswell (the incoming Chairman) would like me to play in the future in this effort.
38	Stan
39	It should be the Chairman's choice but I would favor a Houston location.
39	Also, please strongly consider having the Board meeting on Tuesday afternoon in lieu of the golf outing.
39	You might just get some Board members to attend at least one day of the annual meeting.
39	Stan
40	I am aiming for next wekend.
40	I need one more weekend to get the soreness out of my knee which I messed up by playing too soon two weeks ago!
40	Thanks for asking.
41	Thanks for remembering their birthdays.
41	Drive carefully!!
41	See you sometime this weekend
42	I think we should try to keep alot of this out of oour emailfiles!
43	Based upon your representations I see no conflict and wish you well in your new job.
44	Ditto.
44	Busy morning
45	My condolences on the loss of your grandfather.
45	Please let us know if there is anything we can do.
45	Stan
46	You are beginning to realize that time goes by awfully fast and we had better enjoy what we are doing while we are doing it.
46	You never get another chance at today!!
46	End of my phiposophical analysis of life for tday!
46	You are welcome to the car.
46	I will try to bring it tonight or better still can your Mom bring you over to get it tomorrow.
46	Either way is ok.
46	Daddy
47	Steve indicated to me that Koch has a 50% interest in the company.
48	Thanks.
48	Seems like everyone had a good time.
48	Happy Holidays!!
49	A's always please me.
49	You seem to have applied yourself this semester and I am pleased.
49	Congratulations.
50	Thanks for the note.
50	My policy is that I do not interfere in the hiring practices of my direct reports other to ensure that ETS is complying with all Enron policies and procedures.
50	I suggest that you contact Jerry Martin, Phil Lowry and Gary Smith.
50	Good luck on your search!
50	Stan
51	Will do.
51	Thanks!
52	I have asked Wilson Barbee t9o see if he can provide any assistance to you.
52	I do hope you find something that meets your qualifications.
52	Thanks for keeping me updated.
52	Stan
53	I can play on Sunday morning this week.
53	My eldest daughter has a Horse Show that I need to be at on Saturday.
53	Next week I could play either Saturday or Sunday.
53	Please let me know.
54	Looks ok
55	looks good
56	This looks ok to me.
57	I agree with Jim; it doesn't cost anything to listen.
58	I agree with most of this but have found from experience that if you give originators the freedom to pursue deals with little restrictions the deal flow improves dramatically.
58	For EOTT, we want to pursue acquisitions of energy assets period..
58	We do not need to limit ourselves to the crude oil business.
58	In fact a portfolio of assets would likely reduce the companies overall risk to crude prices.
58	Second, we want to avoid any additional exposure to commodity prices.
58	Therefore, fee based business structures are the best fit.
58	That would include pipeline acquisitions (crude, liquid, natural gas, CO2, etc) as well as fee based processing.
58	Non-qualified income based aquisitions are also ok as long as they are fee based-type deals 9IE..electric generation).
58	Terminals are also an excellent acquistion for MLP,s.
58	Does this get to your issues?
58	Thanks
59	Who is playing on Sunday besides me!
60	A report would be fine.
60	You two are the experts.
61	I will see you at 9 am on Sunday.
61	I am looking forward to playing again and to seeing you after almost a month.
62	Thank you for sending these reports to me.
62	They are informative and timely.
62	By the way, did you get Randy Horton's power of attorney form?
62	She has asked me to invest some of her excess cash and I executed the form and thought she had mailed it in. Please let me know.
62	Thanks to you and David for the outstanding service.
62	Stan
63	Good luck to you.
63	Hopefully I can get out there this afternnon and see you ride.
63	I love you.
63	Daddy
64	This looks good!
64	Thank you.
65	I heard you are scheduled for another interview.
65	Good luck.
66	Just a note to say Good Morning.
66	See you this afternoon at EOTT.
66	Stan
67	The Board of Directors of GISB decided yesterday at their quarterly Board of Directors meeting to continue discussions with EEI and other interested groups regarding the formation of an Energy Standards Board.
67	Stan Horton, GISB's Chairman, stated "while there are many differences between the approaches advanced by GISB and EEI, there are also alot of similarities."
67	GISB is hoping to respond to the stawman advanced by EEI by the end of January.
67	GISB is also seeking input from other interested industry segments on the two proposals which have been advanced thus far.
68	Thanks
69	Please just call Cindy Stark to get on my calendar.
69	I would warn you that I cannot see expending money for such a book since I do not see any value that would be added.
69	It would be nice to have but I was turning down painting projects on our pipeline that were in the $10k range during oour budget cycle!
69	Stan
70	Glad you finally made it!
70	Good luck on your Legal exam today.
70	Get some rest and start studying for Wednesday and Thursday exams.
70	The finish is close at hand.
70	Enjoyed taking you last night.
70	I like the time alone with you.
70	Saturday, I have a haircut at 2:30 so we can start shopping at 3 or go early and be done by noon.
70	Let me know and send me your Mother's list!
70	Dad
71	There is sure alot of scheduled activity where there is no revised completion date or a note that it is completed.
71	Can we get an update?
72	I am very pleased and wish you all the best in your new job.
72	Please keep me updated on how you are doing.
72	I guess this will make your Holidays a little better!
72	Stan
73	Caron mentioned it to me but we did not have time to talk about it.
73	I will talk with her this weekend and see what she has to say.Hope everything is going well.
74	Sunday morning works best for me.
74	It is supposed to rain on Saturday.
74	Stan
75	By the way I have the sweater you wore last Sunday that you left on the golf cart.
76	The press release looks fine
77	Great.
77	Just what we needed.
78	I am glad that everything worked out.
78	Good luck in your new job!
79	Thanks.
79	Glad you had a good time
80	John and I agreed that we would not send the letter at this time.
81	In reviewing the key items of your business review with Jeff Skilling, he had some issues with your new Broadband business.
81	Please provide me with some more detail as follows: It was mentioned that we had spent around $13 million thus far on dark fiber.
81	How much of the resultant capacity has been sold?
81	Are we laying the dark fiber at risk?
81	In other words are we taking a long position in dark fiber.
81	What is our capacity situation today?
81	Do you have a business plan for this new venture..ie what is the anticipated capital expenditures annually for this venture.
81	Who are the customers?
81	What is the expected return?
81	What is the payback on our investment, etc. Who approved the formation of this new venture and the capital commitment?
81	Anything else that will help me get a clear understanding of what we have and where we are going with it.
82	Love you too.
82	I wrapped Mom's present.
82	It is ready for you ton pick up.
82	Gave Mom your allowance this morning.
82	Sorry I forgot o9ver the weekend.
82	Dad
83	Rod Hayslett has it I believe.
83	They just do not give up!
84	Please handle
85	I have forwarded your memo to Mark Metts who is handling the sale of Enron Wind.
85	Mark will make the necessary contacts.
86	That is fine with me.
86	I would like to get this approved as soon as possible.
87	Thanks.
87	I thought it was a good time also.
88	I wasn't sure if you got my response to your email.
89	I wish I could be there to see her face too.
89	Take pictures!!
89	Sorry I will be unable to see you this weekend.
89	Talk with you tonight.
89	Daddy
90	Yes
91	I will do whatever you would like to do.
91	Saturday is fine.
91	Let me what time and I will be there.
91	I have no specific plans.
91	Dad
92	THANK YOU!
92	Sorry about the admin gaffe.
93	I think the best way to handle this is for you to get with Mary Joyce and her team and work out the details.
93	I think the last item may be of some concern.
93	If there are issues that can't be resolved between Mary and you I will gladly get involved.
93	Does this sound like a good plan?
94	Tuesday works for me.
95	This should be the first major step to getting this done.
95	Let me know if I can be of help!
96	I am glad that your Mom is happy!
96	It means alot to me.
96	Sorry you are not feeling well.
96	I'm not either.
96	I have not felt well since I gave blood on Friday.
96	Talk with you later.
96	Dad
97	UNFORTUNATELY!!
97	work totalled interfered with my plans to go to the Masters last weekend.
97	I was so mad I didn't even want to play golf.
97	I am over that now and would like to play this coming weekend.
97	I can play Saturday morning (need to finish by 2pm).
97	or Sunday morning.
97	I will be out of town Wednesday thru Friday so just let Cindy know if anyone can play.
97	Have a good week.
98	Forgot about Easter.
98	I am not that religious either but no sence in taking chances.
98	Saturday is good.
99	I am glad it made you happy.
99	That is very important to both Caron and me.
99	It is nice to see you excited.
99	It made our day too.
99	Stan
100	If the sales representative from the Jaguar dealership calls please get in touch with me.
100	Have a good morning!
100	The Boss
101	Good morning.
101	I'm at EOTT .
101	Talk with you later.
101	Stan
102	I would love to come and participate.
102	I think the best I can do is come in the night before and perhaps(?) attend the night game and then do the golf tournament the next day and leave after the dinner.
102	Talk with Dave about who I should be paired up with.
102	I would like to play with either him or Mike McGowan also.
102	Tell Dave he stood me up last year but it was worth it.
103	Probably replacing Ken Harrison with myself is the right movr.
103	Please go ahead and handle making the necessary changes.
103	Thanks.
104	I checked with Rick Buy's group on where they were on The RAROC analysis of your proposed broadband project.
104	They aren't doing anything according to Rod who checked for me.
104	It seems to me that we need to do several things to either kick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a sale.
104	1.
104	We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to the transactions being proposed.
104	I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this issue.
104	2.
104	We need to determine EBS interest in this business..ie are they a buyer or seller of Portland metro dark fiber.
104	If they want to be in this business wouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in a sale?
104	3.
104	A project of this size will take Jeff's approval.
104	The projected Phase I capital is above my threshold.
104	I will talk with Kevin Hannon and Mitch and then get back with you.
104	Sound like a plan?
105	I am here.
105	I will leave the office about 2pm.
105	I'll see you this weekend.
105	Good luck on your test on Thursday!
105	Dad
106	Would you please look into this and advise me as to whether we can do this.
106	Also, Rod Hayslett is checking with Michael Anderson on whether Wessex would like to perform certain billing and payable functions for Enron Europe.
107	Who is going to put our presentation together?
107	I will give it if you and Bob feel that is the right thing to do but I just do not have time to put the presentation together.
107	Stan
108	Please advise
109	FYI> Responce requested.
109	Thanks
110	I go to Washington DC tomorrow morning returning on Wednesday evening.
110	I will not be in the office either day.
110	Do you want tickets to Astros game on Friday night?
110	If so let me know.
110	They play St. Louis with Mark McGuire.
110	I know you will do great this week.
110	You are always prepared.
110	Good Luck.
110	Daddy
111	Good luck and thank you for a job well done.
112	If you need my signature you should get it by noon on Monday or it will have to wait until Thursday.
113	The Red Rock expansion needs to get approval at the May 1st Board meeting.
113	The procedure is to submit it to the Finance Committee of the Board for approval .
113	Assuming the Finance Committee approves the project they would recommend it to the Board for approval.
113	By this memo, I am requesting that Rod coordinate with Rick Buy to get it on the Finance Committee agenda.
113	I will be in town for both the Board meeting and the Finance Committee meetings.
113	If formal presentations are required at the Finance Committee we can decide who should do them.
113	It is my understanding that no presentation needs to be done at the Board meeting.
113	I will check with Jeff to see if he wants a formal presentation to the Finance Committee or if he will do it himself.
114	The engagement letter was mailed last week.
114	If you do not get it by tomorrow please let me know.
114	Thank you.
115	Thanks for the update.
115	I agree that getting the past amount will take some time.
116	Thanks for the update.
116	Going to one of the power desks was a good move.
116	Experience on the desk will prove very valuable in the years ahead.
116	I hope you made your Dad pay a premium for those peakers!
116	Stay in touch.
117	Since we are in the process of trying to exit this business the answer from Enron Wind would be no.
117	You might want to contact Condy Plson to see if the idea has any value to Enron.
118	I agree.
118	There have been way too many surprises from this group lately.
119	I will do whatever I can.
119	Joe is a real good person.
119	Besides I think you could become a very good regulatory analyst for us and Joe would be a wonderful teacher.
119	I hope everything works out for you personally and professionally.
120	I have the tickets.
120	Invite some friends if you want because I have four tickets and no babysitter.
120	Perhaps your Mother would like to go.
120	Have a good day.
120	Sorry I have been so busy this week.
120	Daddy
121	Congratulations.
121	It totally made may day also!!
121	I was coming back downtown from EOTT and went down Westheimer.
121	When I passed the old apartments I lived in for awhile all the bad days came thundering back and I just about lost it!
121	So you made my day!
121	Thank you!
121	Love, Daddy
122	The letter looks good.
122	It is factual and correct.
123	Contact Joe and suggest that he meet with you while you are there or I could do it for you.
123	Let me know.
124	I w3ill take them over to your Mom's or leave them with Debbie.
124	If they are not at your Mom's, they are at my house.
125	OK..
126	Are you sure Lohitt is the right person to do this job.
126	What about EOTT?
126	No one at EOTT even knew that Steve was leaving before I told them last week.
126	Communication skills are crucial in this job and I never thought that was one of Lohitt's strong skills,
127	That is not the issue.
127	By putting us in the middle between GTB and Solar we would be the ones that would have to resolve any differances between the wo if the unit does not function properly.
127	The whole deal gets complicated since there is a design engineer.
127	oerator and equipment manufacturer and we get in the middle between the equipment manufacturer and owner.
127	If the unit does operate properly, everyone will point fingers at everyone else, I have seen this happen coutless times on EE&CC projects.
127	Why do I want to take this risk on an international project that according to Jerry's own numbers gets me about $800,ooo in current perios earnings and another $400'ooo deferred over many years.
127	It just is not worth the time and risk for that kind of money.
127	I think Phil Lowry agrees with this assessment also.
128	I waited to get you one until they worked out all the kinks.
128	See how thoughtful I am.
129	I assume you have taken care of this and Jim is available immediately
130	Looks good to me.
131	The information should have been sent to you by now.
131	I was out of town last week.
131	Sory about the delay.
131	Email is a great way to comminicate on this.
131	Thank you.
132	I will call you tonight to catch up on the prom etc. Orlando was ok.
132	Nothing great.
132	By the way, DK, the twins and I will be in Florida June 30 - July 10.
132	When are you coming?
132	We will need to get plane reservations ASAP.
133	This is the entire conversation that I did not send previously.
134	Glad you could join us.
135	Great idea!
136	If you are bored go work out!
136	That is time consuming and good for you.
136	That is fine with the credit card.
136	If you work out it is ok to go shop and put it on the credit card.
136	Just not too much.
136	By the way DK's birthday is April 30 and the JJ's are May 2.
136	No one expects presents but it would be nice if you got DK a card.
136	She is taking your car in today to be fixed.
136	Daddy
137	Friday is fine with me.
138	I am not aware of any other conflict with schedules.
138	I suggest we go ahead with the meeting.
139	Glad you could make the trip.
140	The game was awesome.
140	Our tickets were directly behind homeplate.
140	Debbie said she could see me on every pitch and knew that I left the bootom half of the 8th inning.
140	She said I never picked my nose once on camera.
140	Pretty good, huh.
140	Have a good day.
140	Talk with you later.
140	By the way, your car is done.
140	They had no problem removing the oil filter at all.
140	They only had to wriggle it a little bit.
140	Love, Daddy
141	Short and to the point.
141	No changes
142	Sounds good about the car and the horse show.
142	WHERE is David staying this weekend when he comews up.
142	I am not sure I approve of this.
142	What is the deal?
142	Email me at home.
143	Yes.
143	Let me know about follow=up plans.
144	Workout, study, study and then go shopping for something new.
145	Thanks rae.
145	Debra Peppers is persistant so Flashfind may very well join our organization.
145	$5,000 is good!
146	Please send a list of corporate types who could act a executor.
146	I will get back ASAP.
146	Thank you.
147	Please go ahead and execute.
147	Thanks for checking with me.
148	I will continue to host them as long as I am on the Board unless someone else is dying to do it.
149	Thanks.
149	I am glad everything is going well with the newlyweds.
149	Debbie and I share some Astros tickets with some other people.
149	Don't know if you are an Astros fan but we would love to have you and Ann join us at one of the games.
149	We miss you on Saturdays.
149	I am getting better.
149	94 last week with three triple bogeys.
149	I can feel an 89 in the not too distant future.
149	Stay in touch.
150	Great.
151	Right now, we are concentrating on disposing of all Azuriz assets other than Wessex and Buenos Aires.
151	John Garrison and Michael Anderson are handling getting CA's executed and books out to the respective parties.
151	Just contact Michael directly about getting this kicked-off.
151	Thanks.
152	I agree.
152	I suggest the following.
152	Joe, we need you to go give a pitch to Massey's assistats about what is going on.
152	Next Jerry Halvorsen has scheduled a lunch with Massey in two weeks.
152	He has invited me to attend.
152	What do you think?
153	No. The GP contribution is enough.
153	I don't want to go to Jeff for another $2 million.
154	After giving it some thought I think just naming Debbie as executor and agent is the best course of action.
154	Debbie is fine with this approach.
154	Thank you.
155	I will be in attendance.
156	I will discuss your recommendation to seperate PGE from Enron's Health and Welfare Benefits with Cynthia Barrow and Mark Metts in the near future and will get back to you once that meeting is over.
157	I can play.
157	That actually works well for me.
158	Contact Lou Pai.
158	He is heading up our new Xelerator program that is looking at new business opportunities that are outside of our mainstram businesses.
159	The list looks complete.
160	30 days is acceptable.
160	This is extremely important to us.
161	We cannot afford a communications or performance breakdown.
161	I am looking to you to insure that one does not happen.
162	Thanks for the report.
162	Just what I needed.
163	Thanks for the report.
163	Just what I need.
164	The normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the Executive Committee who then confirm that he meets our requirements for being an Enron VP.
164	I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this process.
164	I am uncomfortable with that due to the fact that if the process is not going to be adhered to anyone can nominate a person for VP based on the strength of an individuals resume.
164	If everyone else agrees to the exception I won't be the one to hold this up but I don't necessarily agree with the exception being granted.
165	What is the subject matter you wish to visit about?
166	I'm glad you had a good weekend.
166	I am taking DK out to dinner tonght so I won't be home.
166	Dad
167	The list looks complete.
168	30 days is acceptable.
168	This is extremely important to us.
169	Thanks for the report.
169	The level of detail was on target.
169	Let me know when you want to discuss comp issues.
170	Thanks for the report.
170	Just what I need.
171	Thanks for the report.
171	Just what I needed.
172	What is the subject matter you wish to visit about?
173	Sorry I guess I didn't read it very well.
173	It's ok with me.
174	Ok.
174	Contact Cindy Stark to make an appointment.
175	I figured this posting belonged to one of you.
175	Please see the message from Danny Jones.
176	I have contacted the relevant people of your interest in the job.
177	This is ok by me.
177	Rick looks like a good candidate.
178	Thanks for forwarding Peter's resume.
178	By copy of this memo I am forwarding Peter's resume to Danny McCarty and Phil Lowry.
178	Danny and Phil: Please follow-up with Vince if you have an interest in meeting with Peter.
178	He seems to be a very qualified candidate.
179	Sorry I guess I didn't read it very well.
179	It's ok with me.
180	Ok.
180	Contact Cindy Stark to make an appointment.
181	I have contacted the relevant people of your interest in the job.
182	Mailing them to the house iis fine.
182	It will give us some weekend reading!
182	Thanks.
183	Thank you for the invitation.
183	Unfortunately Debbie and I will not be able to attend due to previous committments.
184	I know of no changes we need to make to the Board or to the Committee assignments.
184	I will check with Mr. Lay's office to make sure he wants to remain on the Board.
184	I will do that today and have an answer by tomorrow in all probability.
185	Nicely done!
186	It looks fine to me.
187	Jim, thanks for the invitation.
187	I should know by Monday if I can make it.
187	I hiope that is ok.
188	Sounds like you are having a tough week with all the Exchange/Outlook outages.
188	Hang in there.
188	The problems will be resolved.
188	Also, we still like you!
189	Golf is scheduled for 2pm Saturday.
189	Lousy start time but evidently they have a tournament of some sort on Saturday morning.
189	Let me know if you can play or not.
189	It is only you and I. Phone numbers are: work 713.853.6177.
189	Home 281.320.1240.
189	Also please email your phone numbers for future reference.
189	No one has them.
190	Thanks but I will pass for now.
190	I wouldn't mind looking at some muni's with shorter maturity dates though.
190	I am concerned about long-term yields increasing which would mean bond prices decreasing.
190	Doesn't it make since to go with shorter maturity dates ri8ght now?
191	Go ahead and post the response to Gas Control issue,
192	It would be better if Scot contacted EBS directly about a meeting.
192	Kevin Hannon would be the right person.
192	Kevin is the President and COO.
192	I have no idea about whether they are in need of Spectrum's services or not.
192	Let me know when you plan to be in Dallas.
192	My daughter has a horse show (we own three Arabian Horses that she shows) in Fort Worth in mid June and I will try to get up there for at least some of it.
193	Unfortunately I am not going to be able to accept your generous offer to attend the Indy 500.
193	My wife and I have 1 year-old twins and I was hoping to get our Nanny to pull some week-end duty to help my wife with them as I went to the races.
193	Unfortunately I was not successful in doing that.
193	Leaving her to look after two infants while I attend the races didn't seem right.
193	Thanks for the invitation!
194	I am on for golf on Saturday if anyone is interested.
194	Tom, can you make the T time?
194	Saturday morning early is better for me.
194	830 to 9.:00 am start
195	Q2 earnings report looks very good!
195	Congratulations.
195	I will keep it quiet until you are sure of the numbers.
195	We should let Causey and Hayslett know for planning purposes ASAP.
195	Given the recent events related to the proposed sale do you think it is even worth discussing the Benefits issue with Corporate?
195	Also, have we finalized all of the divestiture/retention deals?
195	Have a good week.
195	Thanks.
196	Thanks for the report.
196	Anything you need help with?
196	Did all the compensation issues get resolved with Gary and you?
197	For your information.
197	I still think we can do better than this.
198	After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.
198	The first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial exposures to changing prices.
198	The second is the rate case.
198	I would be happy to return to Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast of players.
198	I am open to suggestions from you.
198	Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.
198	Thanks!
199	You and I need to sit down and discuss in some detail John Ale's contract and yours.
199	Let me know when a good time would be.
199	thanks
200	Peggy, that all sounds very goo.
200	I will attempt to get educated first and then we will set up a meeting.
200	Thanks for being so cooperative.
201	Thanks for the note.
201	O agree these items Colin and you are looking could be good for both entities.
202	It was so nice to hear from you.
202	I am glad all is well.
202	I am glad the new home is being enjoyed and that you have a job that you like.
202	I am anxious to get the news of the birth of your new grandchild.
202	Please let us know as soon as possible after the Geraldine delivers.
202	Also let us know what hospital she is in where we can send an appropiate gift to mother and child.
202	My best to you and your family.
203	Anything I can do to help?
204	Rick Causey came to see me asking us to firm up our Q2 numbers.
204	Can we let Rick know that your Q2 numbers are likely to be up?
204	If so by how much?
205	Debbie has to be downtown for other reason on May 24th.
205	Could you meet with her about 4:15pm at my office.
205	I will schedule a conference room for your meeting with Debbie.
205	Perhaps yopu could come around 3:45pm and I could go over any and all changes that I have on tem prior to your meeting with Debbie.
206	Looks ok to me.
207	The Madera project in California should not be going forward.
207	We had a meeting whereby we all agreed to cancel this project.
207	Please get with John to see what is up.
208	Please refer to the memo from Billy Lemons, Steve Kean and me dated May 11 regarding 2001 Western Hemisphere Associate & Analyst PRC Program.
209	I just went through a restructuring of my portfolio with Morgan Stanley.
209	I think I am fine for now.
209	Thank you.
210	Approve.
211	Please handle.
212	Corporate comp is relooking at your contract based on our converstion..ieyou would be entitled to severance payment eqyual to 2 year salary and bonus should you decide to leave the company provided that all or substantially all of the Azurix assts other than ?Wessex and Azurix Bu7enos Aires are sold.
212	I will meet with Jim Derrick today to discuss John Ale.
212	With regard to Beckett and Glasford; their agreements provide for retention bonuses provided they stay until September 16th.
212	If they voluntarily leave before that they get nothing.
212	There is no employment agreements in place that link anything to comparable positions titles or anything else.
212	Should we move them over to Enron in Director positions and they are subsequently offerred positions elsewhere in Enron ( once we dispose of non-Wessex and ABA assets) at Director positions, then they have a choice of accepting those positions or voluntarily terminating.
212	Since there is no contractual agreements with these two I do not want to offer any kind of enhanced severance payments to them.
212	I have contacted Ben Glisan regarding Glasford and he is polling his people about their view on an appropiate placement for him.
212	I will talk with you when you return.
212	Thanks.
213	Peggy Fowler should have someone from PGE calling you.
213	If they don't please let me know.
214	I will be there/ Thanks.
215	I bought 5,000 units of Northern Border Partners at $39.56 with part of the proceeds.
215	The roughly $975K is correct.
215	Thanks.
215	Any ideas on the cash?
215	I was thinking about $800k in munis and $800k in S&P 500 index fund.
215	Your thoughts.
216	Please follow-up with Jeff as soon as possible.
216	Let me know when someone has contacted Jeff.
216	Thanks
217	Thanks.
217	Go ahead and release but make sure Mark Metss' group have seen the financials before releasing to UBS.
218	Things are not always as they seem based on further due diligence.
219	I would be happy to meet with you.
219	Just call Cindy to set up a time.
220	This is more information than I think we need to supply.
220	Can we meet to discuss?
221	I will make the tee times and let you know.
221	Steve, I will include you and your wife for Sunday but please confirm if you can make it or not.
222	I cannot play on Thursday but thanks for letting me know.
222	Could you check with Steve and his wife for their availability on Sunday.
222	I emailed him but wanted to make sure he got it.
222	Thanks.
223	I just now got a reply that the email address Steve gave me does not work.
223	I keep getting the mail returned.
223	I am usingDFSWTL@swbell.net.
223	Could you double check this with Steve for me?
223	Thanks.
224	I have no such studies.
225	I will look into this myself.
226	I just wanted to make sure you guys know everything I do.
226	Actually this is somewhat bullish considering past legislative attempts.
227	Cindy double checked.
227	We are ok for 8:15 on Sunday
228	I would appriciate if you would send to me each week the PGE Position Report.
228	Also, at your convenience I would like to spend some time via telephone to run through the report to make sure I understand just what is being reported.
228	I'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early next week.
228	Also, to whom in Risk Management do you send the position report?
228	Thanks.
229	I am open for luch Wednesday and Thursday.
229	Let me know which fits your calendar the best.
229	DK did tell me about the Mark Marin tournament.
229	If your Mom saved the paper let me have it for reference.
229	Did you see the Sunday paper RE: the 100 highest paid executives in Houston?
229	Dad
230	Tomorrow is best for me.
230	I will make reservations as Massas across the street.
230	Does that work for you.
230	Around 11:45?
231	Thank you.
232	I am very happy for you.
232	It sounds as if everything in your life is going in the right direction.
232	I think you will enjoy working in the DC ofice and for Joe.
232	I am sure you will learn alt.
232	Also, thank you for remembering Jason and Jessica's 1 year birthday.
232	The designer T-shirts were great and they look really cute in them.
232	That was very thoughful of you to remember.
232	Good luck!
233	Did anyone make a tee-time for golf this weekend.
233	I can play Saturday as long as we are done by @ pm or any time on Sunday.
233	Please let me know.
233	I can make a t-time but I am not sure what we will get at this late date.
234	I have secured a tee time for Saturday at 9:52 am for the New Course.
234	If I hear from Steve or Tom that they have a tee time already I will email you.
234	So check your email tomorrow and I will confirm the time or call me tomorrow evening if that is more convenient.
234	I look forward to playing given the mastery of the game I exhibited over the final 9 holes last week.
235	Chris, Steve got us a tee time at 7:52 am Saturday on the OLD course starting on #10 tee box.
235	I have told him you will play.
235	See you Tomorrow.
235	Stan
236	Of cource.
236	It is always good visiting with you.
236	See you soon.
237	Ok with me.
238	I have no idea what this project is so an update would be appreciated.
238	Please set something up with my assistant Cindy Stark.
238	Thanks.
239	Nasim Khan is due to rotate back to the states very soon.
239	He at one time worked for TW.
239	He has experience in Business Development.
239	Please give him some time when he calls to see if he can be of some value to our business development efforts.
240	Lunch is not good this week.
240	I have a business lunch tomorrow.
240	Thursday is the GISB Board meeting.
240	Are you going?
240	I"ll give you a ride there and to your car afterwards if you do not need to come back downtown to work. Let me know. Dad
241	Call my assistant, Cindy Stark and set up an appointment.
242	Thanks.
242	You made my day.
242	I think she is kind of special so its nice to hear good things about her.
242	See you tomorrow.
243	I got the Board book and note.
243	Thanks, it made my day.
243	I will be glad to take you to the Board meeting, and to the park & ride or home which ever you prefer.
243	Call me tonight.
243	Daddy
244	It sounds like the due diligence with UBS is going fairly well with no real surprise.
244	The news is good on Indian Mesa I and II both on the deal with AEP and the financing.
244	The real target is completion of the project on time.
244	I am concerned about slippage again on Q2 due to the Greek project slippage and German installations being behind schedule.
244	I am looking forward to seeing the Q2 numbers very soon.
244	What is the issue on the L&S gearbox and what is the potential impact on 01 earnings given your statement that if we do not pass the test, it will present significant problems for 01 US sales.
244	Let's talk by phone this week if possible.
245	I will know our schedule better next week.
245	I would hope we could execute before the end of June at the latest.
245	I will email you again on Monday.
245	Thanks.
246	It is a bad day getting worse.
246	Any more questions about how I am doing?
246	If it rains I am going out and standing in it because it will mean my day is actually improving.
246	Talk with you later.
246	Daddy
247	Yes, please go ahead and send the documents to David.
248	The name sounds ok to me.
248	Better than EOTTMTBE<LP et al.
249	First of all congratulations on completing your degree.
249	Having completed my Masters degree by going to school at nights and Saturdays while working full time I know first hand the commitment that takes.
249	I suggest that you work through Mary Ellen in trying to find the right position.
249	She knows Gary Smith, VP of HR for ETS.
249	Between the two of them they should be able to offer you the right advise.
249	Keep me informed.
250	Dana wins.
251	Q2 needs to be on plan.
251	Work hard!
252	Count me in. See you tomorrow.
253	I don't like the answer tho the last question.
253	Can we add that under the agreements we could cancel as early as (date) but no decision has been made with regards when actual termination would occur?
254	How much does putting out the newsletter cost?
254	How often are you proposing to put it out?
254	Does it replace any other newsletters?
254	Is there any new information in the newsletter or just restatements of what Ken, Mark and Greg have already said?
254	Need to make sure we have included Brian Stanley's group in what constitutes EGS.
254	Especially NEPCO.
255	Lets try it and then try to gauge whether it is accomplishing anything.
255	I believe our employees are on information overload and putting out another newsletter adds to the overload.
255	I have always believed that if we have an effective Corporate newsletter we don't need these subsidiary newsletters.
255	Meaningful information can be included in the corporate newsletter.
255	At ETS we used to have periodic FYI newsletters that were directed at key topics we needed to cover.
255	You and I also need to do a budget review.
255	The cost I am hearing from your group are to big for EGS to support.
255	I had truly hoped that Gina's group combined with you and perhaps one other person could cover EGS.
255	Gina's group was covering ETs and EOTT.
255	I think Adam has a PR person so we need to find out what PR costs are in the Wind company.
255	Also NBP's has there own PR person.
255	Please set up a meeting with Cindy and Tracy.
255	Thanks
256	I have it on my calendar and Debbie would like to come also.
256	The plane can only fit so many so be careful you don't over invite if they are counting on the plane for transportation.
256	Thanks.
257	I hope you are exercising reguarly given your chips, salsa, dip and beans.
258	I am having lunch today with El Paso's CEO for their international group (Byron Kelley).
258	The meeting was set up to discuss El Paso's public positions in Brazil and the problems Orlando was having with them.
258	I will add your concerns to the list of items to discuss and get back with you.
258	Stan
259	Do yyou mind ig I give the attachment to Byron Kelley?
260	I met with Byron Kelley who runs El Paso's international business.
260	He is an old business aquaintance that I had not visited with in several years.
260	Byron assured me that he would stop the type of press like the article you sent.
260	He reiterated although that El Paso has had good success in dealing with the government in a very private way and did not want to publicise any differences that they may have with the government from time to time.
260	He was willing to stop the press articles that defined differences between El Paso and Enron in their approach to Brazil but had no desire to join Enron in publically trying to effectuate change in Brazil.
260	The meeting was very friendly.
260	Let me know if I can be of further help.
260	Hope all is well with you and you and your family.
261	Yes
262	With everything that is going on it would be prudent to hold off pursing any acquisitions at this time.
262	Thanks.
263	CONGRATULATIONS> Job well done.
264	Congratulations.
265	I hope somebody else draws my name then.
266	Please call me tonight and five me an update.
266	Good luck on the mythology test.
267	Ask Julie to play with us.
267	I could play Sunday if that would be better.
268	The Wall Street has some good articles.
268	Read it every day this week.
268	Glad Rose and you are doing good.
268	Busy day for me.
268	Lots to do.
268	Call tonight.
268	Love, Dad
269	We definately need to talk ASAP.
269	Please call Cindy or call me at home 281.320.1240.
269	With regard to 1) and 2) the answer for now is no for now.
269	Between Rod and Tod we will keep you covered.
269	You will have to work double load for a while longer with regard to Americas-GM.
269	The O&M makes sence.
269	Go ahead.
269	I will explain all this when I talk with you.
270	It looks good to me.
271	Jack Urquhart has inquired as to his continuing role for providing oversight of the Trojan decommissioning.
271	I think he sits on the review committee.
271	Please give your thoughts on this.
271	I think we need someone from Enron on the committee but given Jack's changing role he may or may not be the right person.
271	Please acknowledge receipt of this given our email difficulties.
271	Thanks Stan
272	Looks good
273	I think we should add to the letter "each year the Chairman of the Natural Gas Council has to privilege to name two individuals to the Council. The experience you have gained as both a state and federal regulator coupled with experience working in the private sector makes you an excellent addition to this years Council."
273	A similarly worded phrase could be added to Rick's.Thanks
274	Calm down.
274	The operative word is it has been put on hold.
274	These are not normal times.
274	No one saw this coming or we could have planned better.
274	Give us a few days to figure everything out.
274	We just made the decision today to preserve cash while we were waiting to see what was going to happen.
274	Thanks for your cooperation which I desperately need right now.
275	Too bad about the Saporito's.
275	It's tough to see a family break apart.
275	It was nice that ours could stay together even if it is non-traditional.
275	You know how much I care about your Mom's happiness and welfare.
275	Too bad about your week coming up but considering the two weeks I have had you get no sympathy.
275	I will be here late tonight.
275	Love Dad..
275	GET THE WSJ EARLY TOMORROW!
276	I agree with your last sentence.
276	Thanks for helping us through this crunch time.
277	Watch the news tomorrow!
277	Big Day!
277	Call me
278	Long term investors get rewarded.
278	Hang in there.
278	You haven't lost until you have sold.
278	Be careful not to let your losses turn into long-term losses.
278	Short-term losses are treated as ordinary income for tax purposes meaning Uncle Sam absorbs 40% of your losses!
278	Then buyback and hold for a few years.
279	Hopefully you know what this is about
280	Done
281	Great
282	Your thoughts.
283	I think this is a good summary of where we are: 1.
283	QF Status: Mirant is willing to provide a legal opinion that it meets the QF status under the PPA if it is required to close.
283	2.
283	A market report should be issued by Mirant today as to the reasons they have only been able to secure $300 million instead of $500 million in insurance.
283	Hopefully this will satisfy the lenders.
283	3.
283	Mirant's proposal went out today on how to protect the lenders if the SHO is extinguished.
283	4.
283	Mirant and GE have agreed to a closing checklist and fee coverage.
283	Things left to do: 1Finalize all documents 2.
283	Receive underwriter approval on the resolution of all insurance claims.
283	3.Agree upon mirror guarantees with Enron and Mission relating to the Union Carbide guarantees.
283	Jeff Donahue informs me that CFSB feels secure that this deal will close on December 15 but not before.
283	The reason is that there are PPA bids that need to go out by that date.
283	Let's keep daily status reports coming.
283	If I have misrepresented anything in the summary, please let me know.
284	I'll be fine.
284	Thanks for thinking of me.
284	I am more worried about the 13,000 people that work for me.
284	Tough time bro'!
284	I noticed yesterday that my hands were staring to tremble a bit.
284	I think I need some time off when this is over..not too much time though.
285	How much did I give Dennis last year?
286	Thanks.
286	Steve has been a valuable asset for Enron and ETS which is exactly why other Enron business units are so interested in his services.
286	I made sure that Steve knew that he could stay with ETS.
286	The decision was his.
286	However, we must always remember that sometimes we need do what is in the best interest of Enron and not just ourselves.
286	Thank you for letting me know your feelings.
287	We will miss you also.
287	Glad we had you for the time we did.
287	See you at the Board meeting.
287	Stan
288	I will be there unless I have to work.
288	For now I am ok.
289	Thanks.
289	I made it clear to Steve that he could have stayed.
289	Steve made the decision that was in his and the company's best interest.
289	He has not contacted me about staying.
290	Thanks Mike.
290	That means alot.
291	Thanks.
291	I have heard from just about all of Steve's reports about retaining him.
291	Steve was given the choice to stay at ETS.
291	He made the choice that was in his and Enron's best interest.
291	Steve is a quality individual and an exceptional leader.
291	His talents need to be showcased and I think he understood that.
291	I appreciate your comments on Steve's replacement.
291	We have finished the interviewing process and will make a choice in the next couple of weeks or sooner.
291	Your recommendation is appreciated.
291	Thanks again for the kind words.
291	Stan
292	Looks like I need to cancel.
292	My wife reminded me that I promised to take my daughter to lunch on Saturday.
292	She hasn't been home in a month and I would like to see her.
292	Can you play on Sunday morning?
292	If so I will try and get a t time.
292	Let me know.
292	Thanks.
293	We are on for lumch.
293	The guys wanted to play golf Saturday at 11:30 but I told them I had lunch with you and couldn't make it.
294	OK but you need to fill out the form and get it to Cindy.
294	If you need help call Cindy.
294	She can schedule the plane for you and probabley take care of the paper work.
295	I would like you to get directly involved in selling the assets we have targeted for next year while overseeing the operations of Mariella, Pete and Orlando.
295	That is alot of stuff.
295	However I will keep you in mind as we figure out who is going to be on the transition team.
296	I will call him again on Monday.
296	Do I get a commission.
296	Just kidding.
297	I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS.
297	PLEASE CALL TOMORROW IF POSSIBLE.
297	I THINK WE SHOULD PUT A NUMBER ON THE TABLE.
298	Supposedly but I am trying to get out of it.
298	I will let you know.
299	Thanks Eric.
299	Nice job handling all of this!
300	We will discuss at the next Staff meeting.
300	Thanks for bringing it up.
300	Any feedback from the floor meeting yesterday would be appreciated.
301	As I said yesterday it is my understanding that we need Dynegy's permission in order to engage in such discussions.
301	I however have not seen the final merger documents so I may be mistaken.
301	Given Dynegy's presentation to the analysts on Monday it doesn't look like the want to divest of the pipes.
301	This is Greg's call.
302	I agree the timing is awful.
302	By this memo I am asking Gary Smith to see if this can be expedited in any way.
303	Please call Cindy and set up a time for us to chat.
303	If it would be helpful I would gladly to a phone meeting with your Direct reports.
304	Are we sure we want to do a Board presentation on my group.
304	Everyone is so busy doing a presentation is not on anyone's priority list?
304	If so do we want to just do the pipes or all of Global Services?
305	Good job.
306	Thanks Ken.
306	The Dynegy folks took me to New York for the analyst prsentations and made a big deal about Enron's pipelines and about me coming over.
306	The only problem is they never asked me if I was planning on going over.
306	I know their CEO and COO very well so I will probably have a choice.
306	I would like to see this thing through.
306	I committed in my current contract to stay until 3/1/05 so I would like to keep my commitment even though the options they gave me sign the contract are worthless.
306	I do feel an obligation to help right the ship.
306	My businesses keep performing well and are anchoring the ship right now.
306	Employees are pretty scared so having some key executives stand up and commit to stay is pretty critical.
306	Either way I will be fine.
306	Thanks for your concern.
306	It means alot.
306	Stan
307	I trust everything is going well.
307	Please let me know if there is anything I can do.
307	At the next Board meeting I am sheduled to provide the Board with an update of Enron Global Services.
307	Could you have someone prepare a couple of slides on Portland.
307	One should deal with the major accomplishements of your group in 2001 (ie rate case etc) in bullet form.
307	The second should be an update of the deal with NNG.
307	Perhaps a summary of the deal and then where we are in the timeline of key events.
307	Call if you have questions.
307	Thanks.
307	The Board meeting is scheduled for December 6th.
308	Thanks Mike.
308	Much appreciated.
309	I am ok with the release and the MOU.
310	Thank you Rick.
310	Those were very kind words.
310	Everything will turn out ok.
310	I believe that.
311	Thank you for your kind words.
311	We will get through this and we all will be better for it.
311	Lessons are sometimes learned the hard way.
312	I can't begin to tell you what my days are like now.
312	Unbelievable is the only way I can Describe it.
312	Not much time to do anything.
312	Stress is at a record high.
312	We will get through this though.
312	DK and I will be going to the game tonight to see the Lakers.
312	Talk to you tomorrow, Love, Daddy
313	Thanks.
313	You got the message correct.
313	We will not accept a firesale price but if the price is fair we are sellers.
313	It is a tough message to deliver but people need to hear the truth.
313	I appreciate your efforts in arranging the floor meeting.
313	Any news on Eco?
314	I am sorry I did not get to you first and let you know.
314	My apologies.
314	I really appreciated your interest in the position and your commitment to ETS.
314	You are a quality individual and I respect you for that.
314	Thanks.
315	My apology for missing the Dynegy Board meeting that Ken told me today at !:00pm that you wanted me to attend.
315	I had my international team in for business and budget reviews and to discuss what "non-core" means since both Dynegy and Enron have labeled them as such.
315	We need to keep these folks motivated to get us through the sale process.
315	I couldn't reschedule them since they were heading home tonight.
315	They are fine and willing to see this through.
315	Please let Chuck know that I just had a conflict.
315	Congratulations on a very successful rollout with the Analysts on Monday.
315	Sorry I couldn't go to Chicago with Chuck but it appeared I would have been a detraction.
315	I would like to sit down over luch with you when you have the time to see what your plans are.
315	In the meantime call if I can be of any help.
315	Stan
316	The total bonus pool needed for EGS is $54,800,000.
316	The amount charged and paid by joint ventures is $5,091062.
316	The Enron portion would thus be $49,708,938.
316	This is a reduction of $14,846,779 for 2001 bonuses charged to Enron.
317	I know it must be frustrating being a ocean away and not really knowing what is going on.
317	I can assure you that at times I too feel that I do not know everything that is going and that is probably correct.
317	I can tell you that Jeff McMahon did receive the offer from the Royal Bank of Scotland at or around RAB.
317	I have supplied him the potential financial impact of Enron accepting that offer.
317	As of yesterday no decision had been made about responding to their offer.
317	I suspect that a decision should be made early next week.
317	I would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me.
317	Ken Lay and Dynegy have both characterised Enron's investments in water assets as non-core which means of cource that they will be divested in due time.
317	I would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment.
317	We all recommended that if Enron could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell Wessex at or around RAB.
317	That is where we are right now.
317	Again, please send me your comments.
317	I would try to keep this confidential since we have not yet made a descision.
317	I am sorry if I have not done a good job of communicating with you the past few weeks.
317	Things are quite hectic as you can imagine.
318	Thanks for the update.
319	Do we have to pay them!
320	Thanks.
320	I am not surprised that we asked to meet with them but I am surpeised that Jeff did not mention it to me.
320	Communication here is not great.
320	Stan
321	No problem.
321	Prudent actions given the circumstances.
322	I will await Jeff's call.
322	Can you fill me in on what is happening with Wessex.
322	Colin Skellet has been notified that the potential buyer is coming here to have discussions with McMahon.
322	I need to get in the information loop if at all possible.
322	Thanks
323	Quite frankly I am getting tired of memos like this!
323	There has not been a decision not to provide short-term liquidity for Enron Wind.
323	If there was I would have called.
323	Enron is in the midst of a liquidity crisis.
323	I need the support of the entire team as does Enron to help us get through this.
323	I need you to see the bigger picture and to think of ways that Wind can help.
323	I need cost reductions, improved cash flow and SUPPORT.
323	Thank you!
324	What meeting on Tuesday?
324	No one has informed me of a Tuesday meeting.
325	I like it.
325	Thanks.
326	From a valuation standpoint I assume Case 1 would give us the highest multiple.
326	The issue is is it doable?
326	We have achieved $600 million last year.
326	Also, before we go further with Project Armstrong I would like to get Whalley and Dynegy to agree that if the discussions are successful we would do the deal.
326	Let's suspend these discussions for the time being.
326	Stan
327	We need to get this done.
327	What other resources do you need to get this deal done.
328	I know the value Phil has brought to this effort.
328	I also know his plate is full and I am glad you will assisting him on getting the EOTT problem under control.
328	PLEASE keep me updated.
329	Yes the weather has turned somewhat colder.
329	Busy day.
329	Call tonight.
329	Love you.
329	Dad
330	Given our limited corporate resources, can we cut the IT newsletter?
331	Ken has forwarded to me your letter of October 18 wherein you asked how Enron wanted to handle several activities which you are now engaged (Trojan nuclear plant decommissioning, contract review for offshore sales and rep agreements and involvement in Transparency International).
331	Ken has asked me to work with you on this.
331	Please let me know a good time to discuss.
331	Thank you.
331	Stan Horton
332	Thanks.
332	To date I haven't heard anything from GISB.
333	That is your call.
333	I am trying to make sure everyone is looking at their group and properly assessing where we can become more efficient.
333	You have to way the benefits vs. cost.
334	I thought we should review the process with Mark and Jeff first.
334	I will go ahead and invite either Jeff or Ray.
335	Thanks.
335	That means alot.
336	Agree.
336	We could waste alot of time with Candover and not get anywhere.
337	Thanks Mitch.
337	I have 18 month old twins who could care less about my distractions.
337	They are my stress outlet now.
337	Happy Thanksgiving.
338	This does conflict with a meeting I have in Washington D>C> with Nortwest Natural that Dick asked for.
338	Your call on rescheduling the meeting with Candover.
339	BUMMER on the test.
339	Let it go an do well on the next and it won't make a difference.
339	You are welcome anytime on Thanksgiving.
339	I have some papers that you have to get notarized on Friday.
339	I have also scheduled to have you Explorer for an oil change and lube job.
339	I assume you have not done this yet.
339	Write back
340	Thanks Frank.
340	I will look over the resumes but given Enron's current condition we are not doing any new development projects outside of the pipelines and are relying on Corporate Development to assist with asset sales.
340	Given all that I don't believe I have a spot for anyone.
340	Quite frankly, I am concerned about keeping all that I have.
341	Given where we are I tend to agree with theswe statements.
342	No problem at all.
343	Please set this up for Monday.
344	Sorry but it is Enron's policy not to comment on these types of things.
344	Rest assured that we have very experienced people who are evaluating offers we receive for any asset.
344	Thank you.
345	Ok, but please expedite.
345	Also, you should be aware that Todd has informed me of his need to pursue going on short-term disability.
345	We are looking at internal candidates to serve as the CFO for the interim period as we seek to seel Enron Wind.
345	You will of cource have input into the decision.
345	My first interview is Monday with a Mike Miller who is in corporate development.
345	I will keep you informed.
346	I am glad it worked out for you.
346	It will be interesting to see how things unfold in the days ahead.
347	Thank you Frank.
347	That means alot.
348	Good days are now impossible!
349	Congratulations on your test.
349	Proud of you.
349	Everyday is tough.
349	I can't tell you what its like other than tough.
349	Love, Dad
350	Thanks.
350	Right now I know of no available opportunities but will keep you in mind.
351	I think we should talk with them if the have the cash.
351	However, I get very nervous when anyone would commit $100 to $200 million with limited due diligence.
351	Also, I would not want to announce anything until the deal closes.
351	Preannouncing a deal of this size isn't goi8ng to stabilize anything.
351	$1 to $2 BILLION might get a different answer.
351	As to your involvement, you made the right call.
352	You have my permission to just refer them to Jeff Donahue.
352	Jeff is in the process of naming individuals to assist in the disposition of our international assets.
352	Corporate development, EGAS and investment bankers will collectively pursue the disposition.
352	I woould think Dr. Boyce should be so advised of the process we are going to use.
352	Jeff or his designee can deliver this message if you would like.
352	Jeff, I assume this is the right approach given our converstion.
353	I am ok with this.
353	Bill has done a good job.
354	Thank you.
354	I feel I have neglected Wessex and you with all that is going on.
354	The truth is that John, Michael and you are very capable of proceeding with little input from me.
354	I did make sure with Corporate Development that Michael had to be involved along with you and your team.
354	Communication here is not the greatest so please keep me updated.
354	Thanks.
355	It seems we could be more responsive than this.
355	Gary, can you help.
356	Thanks Mike.
356	Should have known you were in control of the situation.
356	By the way, how are you doing with all of this?
357	I am doing ok.
357	Needless to say I am disappointed but I am trying to provide some leadership.
357	Thanks for asking.
358	Please call to set up a meeting.
358	We should include Michael Anerson in the call.
358	There are updates that I need to provide you with.
359	Debbie: Let me know if you get this.
359	Cindy
360	What is wrong.
360	My Blackberry did not pick up the email you were responding to
361	Thanks.
361	Please make sure Bob Kelley is on the list.
362	Happy Holidays to you and your Staff.
362	Selling Wessex is the rifht move for everyone.
362	I am glad that things arew going well.
362	@et me know if I can be of help.
363	Thanks Mike.
363	We all will need to do our best to get this turned around in 2002.
364	Set up a meeting with Cindy
365	Can you get a card to send to Morris?
366	I doubt anybody wants that to happen.
366	This issue is are we now at the point that Enron Wind cannot generate enough cash to meet its own requirements.

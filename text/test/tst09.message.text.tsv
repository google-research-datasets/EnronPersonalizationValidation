0	No problem.

1	Bob -- Before we do anything on this issue, I would suggest that we need to have developed a strategy on a number of issues (primarily the proper reformation of the PX Credit calculation after Jan 18 and the application of the 1c/kwh surcharge).
1	On this issue, assuming that we haven't discuss the failure of SCE to apply our account's past credit with the CPUC (given that the bills were just received), I can't imagine that a federal court would look to favorably upon a legal action.
1	In addition, we have not identified where the "credits" are if they are not on the customer's accounts.
1	My recommendation is to first (a) work with SCE - have Jeff Dasovich run the traps and (b) discuss the issue with CPUC Division of Energy and see if there is a solution without Complaint.
1	If this doesn't get us anywhere before August 19, then it seems that to protect our interest we would need to file a complaint with the CPUC.
1	I am not opposed to LeBouef looking into federal action, but that seems a bit dramatic without first trying to exhaust our adminstrative remedies.
1	Please call me.
1	Jim P.S.
1	There is a meeting on the 1c/kwh surcharge with Janet Dietrich today at 1:30 in her office.
1	I think you should attend.
2	I think the best person to provide the affidavits for the PX Credit receivable is Wanda Curry (if we want to make this claim inside of the FERC proceeding - still an open question).
2	Jim
3	Jeff -- Seems to make sense to put out a "What's Up in Sacramento" to the whole business crew with likelihood of success.
3	Best to come from you.
3	Jim
4	Sarah -- We have the last draft.
4	I was talking with Rick yesterday and I don't think that we want to publish it or use it publicly.
4	It did it's primary job of validating that a non-gas model structure would not be harmful to Enron's interests.
4	Give me a call.
4	Jim
5	Yes, if by Aug 19 we don't have the strategy, we should file.
5	But we need a comprehensive strategy before the end of the week.
5	I hope to drive that to conclusion.
5	Jim
6	As some of you may be aware, Dick's consulting arrangement with Enron ends later this fall.
6	In an effort to make the transition as easy as possible, I would recommend that the following people work with Dick to transition on critical committees and tasks (nothing is hardwired, so if we need to change people, let me know).
6	Dick will attend the upcoming WSCC EPITF meeting (not sure of date, but think in the next two weeks).
6	My recommendation is that Steve Walton attend with Dick and become the lead.
6	We may not get a voting seat after Dick leaves, but we should try and cover.
6	Ray Alvarez should attend the WSCC Board Meeting on Aug 27 with Dick to pick up these responsibilities.
6	Charles Yeung should pick up coverage for the FlowBased discussions.
6	Dick will not attend the next meeting in Chicago that takes place on Aug 30.
6	Andy Rodriguez should pick up the Security Coordinator Subcommitte discussions that take place Sept 25 - 27.
6	Dick will not attend.
6	I think that Charles, Ray, Dick and I should attend the NERC Stakeholders Mtg on Oct 15 - 16.
6	Finally, Dave Perrino should go with Dick to the next WSCC OCTPG meeting.
6	Let me know if this transition plan works.
6	Jim
7	Not sure if we can do anything.
7	It's Paul's call.
7	Jim
8	Don't we want the ISO to provide to whom the refunds are entitled?
8	Jim
9	Sue -- We should probably file something on this CPUC docket just ensuring that if these meters are put in place, ESPs have access on a timely basis to the data if they serve the customer DA.
9	What do you think?
9	Maybe the Vinio could help?
9	Jim
10	Can we have a meeting on Friday at 9am this morning as an update?
10	Jim
11	Yes.
11	Shapiro will also attend as I may need to be in Houston.
11	Jim
12	Jeff -- Are you going?
12	The list looks pretty good.
12	If not, we may need to have someone there.
12	Jim
13	Can we talk at 9am your time - lots going on.
13	Jim
14	Jeff & Sue -- We need to discuss at 9am your time (as well as other things).
14	Jim
15	Thanks.
15	Maybe we should have Nancy Hetrick simply put in a place holder.
15	Jim
16	Call Greg Sharp.
17	Janel-- No one on my team is really qualified.
17	Jim
18	RECEIVED
19	Nothing.
19	I'll give him a call.
19	Jim
20	Makes sense to me.
20	Good luck.
20	Let me know if you need anything.
20	Jim
21	FYI
22	Cheers.
23	Guillermo - Can you please find the different prices (coach vs. business) so I can have a record?
23	Thanks, Jim
24	I approve.
24	Jim Steffes
25	Aleck -- Will try and find.
25	Not sure if the material is responsive.
25	Read the article (sending to others on TO list).
25	Maybe Ursula Brenner can help you pull a response together?
25	Jim
26	thanks for update.
26	pls keep sending info.
27	FYI.
27	Some info on the CA experience.
27	Jim
28	Probably have to work through Kaufman for Seminar / Education cost.
28	Jim
29	Agreed.
29	Ray Alvarez is working with Fergus and Watkiss, etal to get this taken care of.
29	Jim
30	Steve -- Alan is on vacation next week.
30	Jeff is tied up.
30	Bryan Gottfredson will be compiling this information.
30	By the way, there may not be a listing of who (meaning generators) is owed how much - wasn't disclosed in the FERC Settlement.
30	Jim
31	With Alan Comnes on vacation starting this week, the primary point person from Enron Govt Affairs will be Ray Alvarez in our DC office.
31	Ray will be following up on this and other filings, etc. on this case.
31	Jim Steffes
32	Lisa -- Please let me know what else I need to do.
32	Jim
33	Steve -- FYI on the information your requested.
33	Bryan is working to pull this together ASAP.
33	What exactly is the deadline?
33	Jim
34	Bryan -- FYI.
34	Not sure if you are going.
34	Jim
35	If you want to talk about the KY issues, probably best to get with Janine Migden.
35	Jim
36	Yes.
37	I can't - in a UNITED WAY event.
37	Jim
38	FYI.
38	The EES USA organization has been reorganized to centralize all sales teams under Jeremy Blachman.
38	Scott Gahn's group stays unchanged.
38	Harry, you and I may want to let people in the field know these changes?
38	Jim
39	Charles + Steve + Ray + Dave + Andy -- There have been a number of e-mails related to my initial request for a transition plan for Dick Ingersoll.
39	By this e-mail, I am asking that Charles Yeung take the lead on ensuring a smooth transition and that all meetings are appropriately covered.
39	Please coordinate as a team to work out the details.
39	Charles please also consider that Jose Bestard will be returning at some point in the near future.
39	Thanks, Jim
40	Howard -- I received a call from Jeff Brown who said that he had visited the NYPSC and NYISO to discuss load curtailment.
40	He had placed a few calls into you and hadn't heard back.
40	When you get back, please let me know where this stands.
40	No big deal, but I want to understand what is going on with the load curtailment efforts.
40	Jim
41	A few thoughts before the NG meeting -- 1.
41	Maybe we should (as a team) call Transelect (Paul Buckman) before our NG meeting.
41	You may remember that Transelect sent an initial letter into Skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the NG application to be managing member of the ARTO.
41	I think that it would be good to call Buckman and ask if he has a better idea than NG.
41	We are right now stuck between two very bad answers - let AEP and FE construct a managing member or have NG.
41	Maybe Transelect has a better solution.
41	2.
41	Chief Issues with NG -- a.
41	are they "really" independent?
41	having a short position in NY and owning generation in NE effectively makes NG into a "market participant" - I think that Enron should make as a hold firm position that to operate an RTO there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independence.
41	b.
41	who do they feel the customer is?
41	maybe we want to get Paul Dawson's take on their business model from the UK.
41	it is critical that the new RTO operators across the country view traders/marketers and generators as their key customers.
41	what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want - pass thru, PBR, etc.?
41	c.
41	who writes the tariff?
41	I would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the RTO work to date has been that FERC has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little (if any) control over future changes.
41	the RTO operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints - (1) must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and (2) must not damage the assets.
41	d.
41	do they intend to build/own transmission and how does this impact the energy markets?
41	will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that EPMI may take in the energy market.
41	how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the business?
41	e.
41	how do they intend to provide balancing energy?
41	the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances.
41	what is NG intending to do on this issue?
41	does NG believe that multiple control areas makes sense for a single RTO?
41	does NG support unbalanced/uncovered schedules day-ahead?
41	Also, just to let people know, Kerry Stroup will also be working on the Midwest RTO efforts going forward.
41	Please keep him included on the e-mails.
41	Jim
42	Leslie - Can you coordinate with Jay Dudley at 503-464-8860 on how to change the filing (if at all) on PGE's pipeline issue?
42	PGE is willing to modify the filing to try and take out the language on Native Load.
42	They are suggesting that maybe they should sign a contract for the full amount of the capacity (about 170,000 mmcf/d) rather than assume its right.
42	The goal should be to have a final decision on next steps before next Friday, Aug 17.
42	Please call me with any questions.
42	Thanks, Jim
43	Jeanne -- Not quite sure that I am getting the picture.
43	Let me lay it out more directly.
43	The PX Credit for October 2000 was $225 based on the actual market rates.
43	Now FERC is saying that October 2000 hourly prices for CalPX DA and CalPX HA markets were "too high" in June 2001.
43	Can the CPUC change the PX Credit for October 2000 and make the Utilities recalculate our Negative CTC?
43	What is prospective?
43	Have they ever done this before?
43	Jim
44	YOUR BUDDY
45	Rick -- FYI.
45	Becky heard Michelle Foss talk the other day.
45	Was very aligned with our perspective.
45	Maybe someone for FERC?
45	Jim
46	Susan - I put together a short write-up and would like to submit to HR for your mid-year.
46	Because you've only been here a short time, most of the responses are To Be Determined.
46	If you don't have any problems, please come by and sign.
46	Thanks, Jim
47	Looks good.
47	Please make sure that you submitted an RCR.
47	If Ed wants more info of this type for other states, I'd like to make sure that we organize our efforts so we don't duplicate too much and deploy the proper resources.
47	Thanks, Jim
48	I agree with Christi's point.
48	The problem is that those arguments - effectively that real competition will take away market power - are no longer effective at FERC.
48	I think that Massey and Wood are ready to do something more potent.
48	My primary question is how do we think that Appendix A would apply to Enron?
48	Do we want Hirenymous (sp?) to undertake a proxy exam to see the real impact?
48	I am going to try and schedule a phone call for next Friday to outline our next steps.
48	Should anyone else be in on the call?
48	Who else could lead this analysis for us (given that we are all so busy)?
48	Jim
49	Linda -- Please arrange a phone call with Christi & Sarah Novosel to discuss market power for this upcoming Friday.
49	Jim
50	I assume that we will discuss the entire process on the next NERC call?
50	Jim
51	Susan -- Please discuss with Ben (you may want to call Barbara & Christi to see if anyone else has discussed already) and relay importance of this to his future plans to me?
51	Key question is whether or not we need to be engaging directly with local governments.
51	Jim
52	Nancy -- Please keep John & Charles in the loop on this question.
52	They are both working on next steps for NERC and while not directly related to the RSB, there is potential for overlap down the road.
52	Also, where does Enron publicly stand on the incorporation of this into an EISB?
52	I thought we were ready to go?
52	Finally, are you giving the presentation?
52	Jim
53	Linda -- Let's talk about all expense report matters tomorrow.
53	Also, please send out reminders to everyone that I want to deal with this only on Friday and not to go too long without a report.
53	Thanks, Jim
54	PLEASE ENTER INTO MY CALENDAR.
54	Jim
55	Ginger -- I am taking that entire week off.
55	Jim
56	Tom -- Can put some analysis into this market opportunity and relay the results to the Enron Direct team?
56	Current Shopping Credit versus 2002 Shopping Credit versus market.
56	Maybe we should be highlighting the opportunity to pick up some quick market share where the saving opporunities are relatively large and have Enron Direct enter now to lock in the deals?
56	Jennifer Thome may be able to help you with this project (although she may have some other projects).
56	Jim
57	Christi - Did this come from FERC??
57	Jim
58	As you can see from the comments below, staff at the Texas PUC is considering whether or not certain areas of Texas are ready for competition (the non-ERCOT region).
58	Who on your teams do we need to talk to understand the implications of this action?
58	Jim
59	Charles & Nancy -- Please make sure that we are on the same page "publicly".
59	Jim
60	Jeanne -- I guess the other big question is this - what is the best argument one could make that any retroactive calculation (and application in a forward-going manner) is illegal?
60	We need to develop this argument ASAP.
60	Jim
61	Rick -- How about sitting down on Wednesday am (say 10 am) to do this?
61	Jim
62	Not sure how this got through the "process".
62	Please feel free to call on me if this isn't getting fixed right.
62	Also, should we just have PGE pull the application and re-file with different terms.
62	Also, Becky you should let Amr know and keep track - he can try and quantify.
62	Jim
63	Great.
63	I'll be there.
63	Jim Linda -- Please put on my calendar.
64	I'll attend if you think it's important.
64	Otherwise, I'm assuming that ya'll are covering the meeting.
64	Jim
65	Dung -- Best to start with Jean Ryall (in Austin).
65	Different utilities in different places of restructuring.
65	By the way, aren't you in EBS?
65	Jim
66	Please put on my calendar if possible.
66	Probably can only go for 1.5 hours.
66	Jim
67	Howard, Kathleen, & Steve -- Can we sit down and discuss our strategies going forward in light of this RD?
67	I'd like to understand where there are opportunities (both for POLR outsourcing and standard market entry).
67	I don't think that there will ever be a huge surplus in generation (and there shouldn't be in a competitive market).
67	Instead of focusing on something the NYPSC can't control, why not work on demand responsiveness?
67	Better metering technology would certainly help.
67	Let me know when a good time would be?
67	Jim
68	Please put on my calendar if possible and RSVP if necessary.
68	Jim
69	Looks good.
69	Are these "incremental" to the total?
69	May be important to highlight the % growth as well.
69	Jim
70	Bryan -- Thanks for the update.
70	On the first issue, there was a letter sent from the CAISO to some Congressmen.
70	Please find this.
70	Also, keep trying to locate the creditors list - we want people that bought and sold electricity.
70	Jim
71	Has your initial question been answered?
71	Jim
72	Here is a list of point people for issues in the West.
72	Jim
73	Did we get the right people to sign-up to speak?
73	Let me know.
73	Jim
74	Not sure if you knew this.
74	Jim
75	Sue -- Is the issue for the Governor's eminent domain or Native Load exception?
75	Very important distinction maybe lost on these guys.
75	Jim
76	Charles -- Very well put.
76	This is another example why it is so important for you and Andy R. to be out with the RTO teams helping us to be more precise.
76	We need to blend our NERC and FERC advocacy.
76	Of course, you realize that ELCON will never support a PJM model central marketplace for balancing energy.
76	At the last EPSA meeting, ELCON really blasted centralized pools.
76	Jim
77	Erin -- Enron is working right now to try and develop its policy on this issue.
77	Clearly, our primary goal is to ensure that market makers such as Enron are treated fairly by the FERC rules vis-a-vis other market participants.
77	While we are not yet enamored with any policy option, we are committed to helping FERC do whatever is necessary to create a strong and well functioning marketplace.
77	As soon as I have any more, I'll let you know.
77	Sarah Novosel and I are intending to come to the meeting.
77	Jim
78	Janine -- Where does this stand?
78	I just read the text and agree with Harry.
78	Most importantly, the HHI may not be suitable given the high degree of regulation of ComEd service.
78	As important, I don't think the ICC cares too much about Enron losing market share.
78	Not the best lead argument.
78	Let's talk.
78	Jim
79	Not until all of the key electricity fixes are included in the package - remember RTOs are still voluntary, the Courts have yet to require FERC to do away with the Native Load exception, and NERC is in charge of reliability.
79	This is clearly the biggest issue for the Publics.
79	Jim
80	Talk with Rick, but I think this project is complete.
81	FYI
82	Lynne -- I am very sorry that I have not yet responded to your e-mail.
82	I am trying to firm up my calendar.
82	Not sure that Excelon and Enron will differ greatly on the key lessons learned.
82	I should know by mid-week (if you haven't already filled the slot).
82	Jim Steffes
83	Dad -- Thought you may be interested.
83	Jim
84	Bob -- Sorry this is just getting to you.
84	Pls work with Fergus to come up with an answer.
84	Jim
85	This is one of those to show to Amr to quantify.
85	Jim
86	Wanted you to see that Doug regarded you highly (my highlights below).
86	Also, sorry I wasn't very nice on Friday - another very bad day.
86	I'm sorry.
86	Jim
87	Evan -- Who is responsible for completing all paperwork for entering a new market?
87	Is it someone on your team or someone from CEC?
87	There have been some issues with getting everything coordinated lately and I wanted to make sure that we knew who was on point.
87	Jim
88	Sorry that I am just getting back to this.
88	I think that one of the key roles for Reg Risk Analytics is to "validate" the appropriateness of regulatory assumptions in EWS retail tariff curves as well as help Govt Affairs build risk management plans.
88	Let's talk soon.
88	Jim
89	Who at EWS is the head?
89	Jim
90	Am I scheduled to attend?
90	Jim
91	correct.
92	I'm in all week.
92	Jim
93	Jean & Thane -- Can we have a meeting this week (maybe Thursday at 3:30) to discuss this?
93	Jim
94	FYI.
94	You may want to discuss with Becky.
94	Jim
95	What do I need to do?
95	Jim
96	Hope he is ok.
96	Jim
97	Janine -- Who is IMServe?
97	I'm guessing they are a vendor that does billing, etc. You should e-mail Evan Hughes to determine the nature of the CSC arrangement.
97	But I don't think that we want to give our business to a company because they help in one case?
97	Jim
98	Linda -- Can you please pull a copy of the ComEd OATT that would include the calculation of "OPC" mentioned below?
98	Janine -- Doesn't it make sense that we are disadvantaged vis-a-vis their own transmission service and should talk to Donna Fulton about a complaint at FERC?
98	Jim
99	But where in statue does the ICC have that as one of their issues?
99	Jim
100	Charles -- In planning the transition, please include this issue.
100	Jim
101	cheers
102	Susan -- Can you please work with ENA Accounting and others to determine the following to provide to EPSA so they can calculate our Dues -- 1.
102	Total megawatts of your company's equity ownership as of June 1, 2001 in competitive generation assets operating and under construction in the United States (including PURPA plants) - (probably good to start with Wes Coldwell).
102	2.
102	Total megawatthours of market-priced wholesale and retail sales for the 12 months ending March 31, 2001 (probably just get Linda Lawrence to sum up our monthly sales (I would have a separate total for wholesale financials) and use someone from Evan Hughes shop for physical retail sales).
102	Call me to discuss.
102	We need to get this in by August 18.
102	Jim
103	Steve -- Has PR given the go ahead?
103	Anything else from me needed?
103	Jim
104	Yes.
104	I'll get us a conference room on 47.
104	Jim
105	Linda -- Please schedule a conference room to hold this.
105	Jim
106	Sue -- Do you have a list of the Commissions / Officials that you have discussed these issues with either formally or informally?
106	It would be good to make sure that we have a running tally.
106	Jim
107	Sue -- What is our current involvement in the URG case?
107	Do we have a range of potential outcomes for each UDC?
107	Jim
108	Jean -- Please call Eric to understand the implications of filing or not filing on this issue.
108	Jim
109	Good idea.
109	Harry is the best to start with.
109	Jim
110	I would like to have a meeting today at 4pm to review the work that West Power URM has been working on to compare the economic impact of the 4 alternatives.
110	It would also be good to get any other feedback from the meetings with SCE and other relevant activities.
110	I will ask my assistant Linda Noske to get a call in number and a room on 47.
110	Please let Linda Noske know if you will attend.
110	Jim
111	Please cover this.
111	Jim
112	To make sure that everyone is on the same page, my understanding is that Thane "owns" this issue from top to bottom - Thane needs to make the recommendation about moving forward or not.
112	Please keep me in the loop.
112	Jim
113	I can't make it, but Sue Mara will cover.
113	Jim
114	Don't worry about the call.
115	Thanks Barbara.
115	If we need to do anything, please let me knwo.
116	Please coordinate a meeting with Chad for later this week between Chad and myself.
116	Jim
117	2:30 works for me on Thursday.
117	Jim
118	Works for me.
118	Jim
119	I can make it.
119	Now on my calendar.
119	Jim
120	Sue -- My take on this letter is that it is a little too "jumpy".
120	Any way to help make it a bit more to help Lynch do something different - maybe work from the AReM filing?
120	Jim
121	Thanks for the accounting treatment.
121	Probably better to have one payment this year and one payment on Jan2 (charged back to 2001).
121	Thanks, Jim
122	Thanks for the feedback.
122	Your model now assumes a modification to the Distribution tariff to include a new rate element.
122	That may get around the Settlement (although OCA in PA will think that now D is going up and there is no offset in the G rate so consumers are getting screwed because they won't switch).
122	Also, can the PaPUC implement this charge and direct the EDCs to transfer the funds to third-party generators?
122	Seems like that would require legislative changes.
122	I like the idea that there should be fixed charge for ICAP - one way to get that number would be to go back to the EDC stranded cost cases and look at their filed testimony - remember if they are earning more from the market than that $ amount, they are overearning on their stranded costs.
122	Jim
123	Send me your phone number?
123	Jim
124	I thought we were responding through some other group?
124	Jim
125	Thanks.
125	Appreciate the concern.
125	Hopefully most of this will be legal time & $ but one never knows.
125	Jim
126	No problem.
126	Have a good vacation.
126	Jim
127	Thanks.
127	The key, of course, is to create a filing that could not be used against us at FERC on these issues.
127	I guess that amending the filing is better than withdrawing the filing and re-submitting.
127	My only thought would be that by withdrawing, PGE provides no trail.
127	Jim
128	Steve -- As Sue highlights below, when people talk about stranded costs ending no later than 3/31/02, they are only speaking about generation-related stranded costs.
128	Above market costs for QFs will be "collected" from DA customers for some time into the future.
128	Wanted to make sure that this was clear.
128	Jim
129	thanks
130	Linda - Please work up some letters from me to the people in the file ECAR, MAIN, MAPP for my review.
130	Thanks.
130	Jim
131	The Offsite is more imporant.
131	Please call Lysa Akin to confirm the date.
131	Jim
132	You on this call?
132	Jim
133	Becky -- What's the upside and downside from the Settlement.
133	My only concern is that FERC is so swamped with issues may be overwhelming.
133	Where is our business going?
133	Jim
134	Linda -- Please reschedule until Wednesday.
134	I have a meeting all afternoon on California.
134	Tell Mike I apologize greatly.
134	Jim
135	Per our discussions yesterday, the following should hopefully be completed before the 2:30 (CST) conference call on Recoupment and the 4:00 (CST) conference call on PX Credit & 1c/kwh Surcharge.
135	1.
135	Bob Williams - Synopsis of 1c/kwh Surcharge 2.
135	Sue Mara - Background on CPUC Activity on 1c/kwh Surcharge (to be included in Bob Williams' write-up) 3.
135	Dian Huddleson - Plan for Requesting Net Bill Reinstatement 4.
135	URM - Analysis of PX Credit Methodology 5.
135	Mary Lynne Ruffer - Analysis of Net Bill Amounts The goal for today is to have all necessary data to develop our recommendations for how to proceed in these matters so that we can meet with the business heads tomorrow.
135	Call In Information - 2:30 Recoupment 4:00 PX Credit & 1c/kwh Surcharge To Be Provided By Linda Noske
136	Wes & Wade -- You've probably seen this, but FERC issued this notice for Jurisdictional Public Utilities related to a FASB decision.
137	Richard -- We need to make some decisions very soon (this morning) about Enron's submission of data into the Pacific Northwest ("PNW") refund case.
137	The data is due at FERC no later than Thursday August 16.
137	The key strategic issues in submitting the data to the ALJ include the following -- 1.
137	Do we exclude bookouts (ie, only physical transactions)?
137	It appears that other market participants intend to exclude bookouts.
137	EPMI should also exclude bookouts given that these transactions never went physical and hence are not appropriate to consider in this case.
137	2.
137	Do we provide only sales transactions or do we include our purchases?
137	The ALJ's Order allows parties to include purchases only if the selling party is not an intervenor in this case and hence, our purchase would not be included in the data.
137	The ALJ wants to limit the amount of data to be provided to ease the workload.
137	Our initial analysis of some data from other parties is that there will be transaction data irregularities and hence, we should provide all of our relevant sales and purchases.
137	By having the data in the case, we can dispute any inappropriate transaction and ensure that all of our purchases are included in the calculation of refunds.
137	This is key for Enron in that our primary defense is that Enron deserves refunds as a purchaser to offset any sales refund amount.
137	3.
137	Do we provide data for all 4 time blocks (through 24 hours, through 7 days, through one month, through 1 year)?
137	The ALJ's Order indicates that parties are to provide data for transactions that are not consistent with the initial definition of "spot" - deals less than 24 hours done day ahead or day of.
137	Our initial recommendation is to provide the data but to retain our arguments that this is not consistent with FERC's Order.
137	The primary downside of not complying with this element of the data submission request is that we anger the ALJ and end up providing the data anyway after being told directly to comply.
137	In addition, it is possible that by providing all of the data we could be creating the problem that some economist or competitor could get their hands on the data at a later date and "determine" our trading strategies.
137	Weighing these risks, I would still recommend to include this data but argue before the ALJ and the FERC the ultimate relevance.
137	4.
137	Do we provide data based on contract date?
137	The ALJ has requested data for contracts that were valid on December 25, 2000 that had physical energy flowing after December 25, 2000 through June 20, 2001.
137	This would explicitly include Balance of the Month transactions for December 2000 and the associated physical flows.
137	To minimize the hours on these transactions, we intend to enter the transaction date in the data submission to allow for FERC staff to delete inappropriate transactions.
137	I will call you this morning.
137	Thanks, Jim
138	Left you off.
138	Sorry.
139	Ginger -- Please send to Rick's team.
139	Jim
140	Steve -- I've stopped trying to understand the Utilities in California and what they want - it hurts too much.
140	But yes, the law allows the Utilities to continue to collect "something" from customers, including DA customers, for QF coJim
141	Ok.
141	If the FERC team in DC (Donna and Sarah) are ok, let's support this but let's make sure that we have outlined our "needs" and "wants" and "no ways" before going in. Also, who would cover and can we do this in Houston (guessing most of the parties in town)?
141	Jim
142	Jeff -- Any communications with ElectriCities on virtual direct access?
142	Maybe another good avenue for ElectriCities to help its members?
142	Now that direct access is dead in NC, ElectriCities could agree to move new products through their stable channel.
142	Jim
143	Why is Buxton upset?
143	This is good for consumers?
143	What does he want to change his mind and push this forward?
143	Wouldn't this just lower the prices to his customers?
143	Also, this is why we need to be constantly pushing the political message in the states.
143	Jim
144	Buxton is not a true consumer advocate - I thought that he was the guy who put MECC's together.
144	We have a relationship with him.
144	Why not work our magic.
144	Jim
145	I'm taking Sept 3 off - I think it's Labor Day.
145	Please also note that I am taking off late in September.
145	Choose the best date to work through for this.
145	Jim
146	Pls update my calendar.
147	Pls put on my calendar.
148	John - Can you please get with Sue?
149	Ask Linda Noske to schedule some time for us to go over.
149	I think it's great.
149	Jim
150	Bob -- Let's discuss today.
150	Jim
151	On what case?
151	Jim
152	Linda - Pls work with Brian Redmond's asst to have a meeting with me, him, Jean Ryall, and Becky Cantrell.
153	Maybe someone from the Risk Mgmt Working Group would also go?
153	Jim
154	Jeff -- Please send the invoice to my assistant - Linda Noske - to have her take it through the system.
154	Her phone number is 713-853-6082.
154	Thanks, Jim
155	Linda -- I thought that Ray set up a daily call regarding the CA and Pacific Northwest Refund litigation at FERC?
155	It's not on my calendar.
155	Can you please call Bernadette Hawkins to verify and put on my calendar?
155	Jim
156	Linda -- Please find out if Gordon, Mary Lynne, and Steve can meet at 2pm to follow-on to our PX Credit discussions?
156	If it does, please find a room on 47.
156	Thanks, Jim
157	Pls keep sending these.
157	I just didn' t know the case.
157	Jim
158	Here are my comments given my very short review of the NGA Statement.
158	18.3.4 Demand Response GOOD 18.5 Improving Energy Transmission OK talks about "equal access for all suppliers" even though says "oppose preemption", indicate a willingness to better coordinate 18.6 Regulatory hard to read if the section on "no preemption of state regulatory authority" is good or bad...we don't argue that our model preempts any authority, only that transmission service is best defined by FERC.
158	Jim
159	Thane -- You are probably already aware but if not, Enron holds an interest in Project Cornhusker (a QF in Cleburne).
159	There are some issues that may develop with the plant related to its ability or inability to meet specific ERCOT guidelines.
159	Generation Investments is managing this asset and relations with Brazos Co-op.
159	Their primary concern is that Mirant is Brazos Co-op's QSE and may be interested in playing games with the plant through modification of ERCOT rules.
159	Please coordinate with Jean and decide who will call either Rick Hill or Chuck Ward.
159	Thanks, Jim
160	Nothing really - he both had the $ to retire and wanted to spend more time with his family.
160	No "forcing" out.
160	Jim
161	Jennifer - I like your #2 and #3 issues for highlighting.
161	On the issue of fuel diversity, Enron has been somewhat agnostic.
161	Please draft some comments and share with Tom Hoatson to submit.
161	Thank you, Jim
162	What was the explicity capacity ($/kw-mo) component by year for PECO in their stranded cost case?
162	Feel free to call JR.
162	Jim
163	Bryan -- Thanks for the info.
163	I think that a Section 4 would be good to add - who is on each list in a "major" way?
163	Sort of your analysis of who is the best company to leverage if we are to work a deal?
163	Jim
164	I have a call into Jean Ryall to discuss.
164	Agreed that we need to keep our FERC team in the loop.
164	Jim
165	When: Friday, August 17, 2001 4:30 PM-5:30 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
166	Yes.
166	Also, best to coordinate with Jeff and Sue.
166	Jim
167	Is it possible for everyone to stay on Rick's Staff meeting (10:30 CST) today to discuss our next steps?
167	I think that may allow us an opportuntity to set up next steps.
167	Jim
168	Do you want to go to Las Vegas for this trip?
168	I love you, Jim
169	Can we talk about this protest at 3pm (using the last 30 minutes of our call on Market-Power analysis)?
169	Also, we need to coordinate this activity with some protests that Janine filed in the Ohio PUC about a failure of implementing a fix for the "native load" exception.
169	Jim
170	Can you get a call in number for 3pm?
170	I want to give to Kerry Stroup and Donna Fulton to discuss AEP NEXT STEPS.
170	Also in the meeting should be Sarah Novosel, Christi Nicolay, Mike Roan.
170	Jim
171	Bob & Ray -- Can each of you please put together a short outline of the (a) timeline, (b) key decision points, and (c) potential outcomes of the decision points for the different refund cases?
171	If possible, having this before today's call would be helpful (but I realize that this may be difficult).
171	Jim
172	Linda -- Please work with Jan. Jim
173	Jeff -- Federico is coming to the states to understand how our policymakers deal with the issue of default service.
173	He is the manager of the Italian default service provider.
173	Can you please make a presentation next Thursday or Friday about the UI deal?
173	Thanks, Jim
174	A couple questions -- 1.Could the company include distribution wires as well, instead of being just a transmission only wires?
174	2.How many shares would a divesting company get?
174	Could this be more that 5%?
174	If so, wouldn't this be over the "control" threshold?
174	In general, I fully support this type of action.
175	Agree.
175	Jim
176	Sarah - I can't open this.
176	Jim
177	Jeff - Sue called on Friday late and had some issue with the research report that was to go out.
177	She didn't give me any details.
177	How do we get to her to discuss.
177	Jim
178	What do you guys think?
178	My idea is to have a short (10 page) presentation that gives a brief update and then make sure that we understand current positions and current projects?
178	1 hour max.
178	The four of us would deliver.
178	Jim
179	Should you be on this service list?
179	Jim
180	Becky -- Thanks for getting this info.
180	Jim
181	good info.
182	Linda -- I'd rather not use the first week in October.
182	I may move my vacation to that week.
182	Jim
183	Susan -- Can you confirm with the desk?
183	My recollection is that the combination would make sense?
183	Also, not sure how this "works" with the testimony we've filed to support natural markets?
183	Maybe Christi can piece that all together or call TCA and get their read.
183	Jim
184	Diann -- What's the next step?
184	Jim
185	Thanks.
186	thanks.
186	Jim
187	thanks
188	Christi -- Please ask each regional RTO heads (all that are being discussed + Mediation) to develop one page memo.
188	May want a map with current config and a map with FERC model.
188	Let's plan on doing for September 11 or September 12.
188	I'll ask Linda Noske to work with Duran's assistant to coordinate.
188	Also, let's give info on current Interconnection issues.
188	Finally, Christi, maybe you could develop 5 key regulatory issues.
188	Jim
189	Janine -- The other thing that I am thinking is that we don't want to file anything at the FERC without a broad coalition.
189	At the right time (after we understand the facts and our desired outcomes), let's sit down and discuss how to approach FERC.
189	I think the timing is right to make a cogent, well-defined argument before FERC but we need to sell this to the FERC before the filing and we need to have Enron as a minor player in the fight.
189	The FERC is looking to help retail markets.
189	Jim
190	thanks.
191	Any thoughts on the NERC budget?
191	Jim
192	Janine -- What's the gas delivery tariff on CGE for generation services?
192	Do they have a standard service?
192	Do they have a good generator interconnect agreement on the power side?
192	Jim
193	Sorry.
193	Pls let me know the outcome.
193	Jim
194	Dave -- I'll look at today.
194	Is there an RCR?
194	Jim
195	I am not attending.
195	Jim
196	Christi -- Can you please send any and all summaries of the RTO Orders mandating Mediation for NE and SE to Vicki Sharp?
196	Also, please include any other information that is helpful to understanding these issues.
196	Thanks, Jim
197	FYI.
198	I wanted to make sure that everyone is on the same page related to utility costs in California.
198	These costs may be (will be?) collected from some utility customer, potentially including direct access customers.
198	About $12.0 Billion (this money includes our Negative CTC amounts).
198	Should be financed through corporate debt.
198	No securitization.
198	Enron's Position: Bundled service on Jan 1, 2001 pays fixed c/kwh Bucket #2 CDWR Cost from Jan 5, 2001 through Bond Issuance or March 31, 2002 About $12.5 Billion (about $10 Billion for spot purchases and $2.5 Billion for long-term buys) Enron's Position: Dedicated Rate Component (DRC) for all residential and small customers.
198	Larger customers are assigned direct responsibility for the Undercollection on c/kwh.
198	Balancing account for holding Utility even.
198	Bucket #3 Prospective Generation Costs for Bundled Service Post March 31, 2002 URG = $40/mwh (retained generation and bilateral contracts) Bucket #4 AB1890 Non-Generation Stranded Costs Bucket #5 AB1890 Generation Stranded Costs
199	Let me know how this turns out.
199	If you need a contact, let me know.
199	Also, everyone should be aware about an aggregation project under Phyllis Anzalone.
199	EES legal has found a loophole to the time restrictions on electricity contracts and the appropriations risk that we need to check out.
199	Jim
200	Ray -- Let's discuss on today's Refund call.
200	Jim
201	sounds good.
202	Guys -- I agree that we need to file at FERC.
202	But we need to also get in the field with a strong message supporting FERC ASAP in the Southeast.
202	I'd rather go down swinging.
202	Maybe a least find out the objections of the parties across the region (including PUCs, stakeholders, etc.).
202	What about building a short schedule?
202	Maybe coordinate with DC office on key members?
202	Jim
203	good job.
204	I think this makes alot of sense.
204	Who would cover PA and NJ at retail - you?
204	Jim
205	Linda -- Please arrange a good time tomorrow or Thursday to talk with Aleck.
205	Jim
206	Thanks for doing this.
206	Jim
207	Probably not.
207	Thanks.
207	Jim
208	When: Tuesday, August 21, 2001 4:00 PM-4:30 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
208	Where: eb47 PLEASE ATTEND IF POSSIBLE.
209	Latest information on CPUC Decision -- Commissioner Bilas filed an Alternative Draft for the CPUC that would: * hold DA suspension and have the CPUC conduct hearings that would work out details including impact on bonds and phasing ending of DA, * resolved issues related to credits and payments of Negative CTC, and * hold hearings dealing with bottoms-up ratemaking for DA.
209	This is effectively an updated version of the alternate that Bilas put out last time the CPUC considered this issue.
209	It is a long-shot that this alternative would be approved.
209	Our current information is still that the CPUC will vote to suspend DA as of Sept 1.
209	Jim
210	John -- How about I take the "delay" side for $200?
210	Jim
211	I think that we should support the effort.
211	I would not get into the specifics in any region or the specifics of the proceedings.
211	This should be an opportunity for Enron to "spin" its message - RTOs help us help our customers....
211	Jim
212	sounds good.
213	Why have exit fees and limit to open enrollment?
213	Jim
214	Right now I'd let the FERC make that call.
214	If asked, Enron believes that incorporating Fla into the Southeast makes great sense for Florida consumers - more access to low cost markets, etc. Why is the fight ours?
214	Let's keep it alive before FERC but not make it a big push for Enron.
214	Jim
215	What happened?
215	Jim
216	John & Louise -- I wanted to make sure that you were aware that FERC has ordered natural gas sellers to provide monthly reporting for transactions relating to California.
216	We are, of course, seeking for FERC to modify its decision.
216	Given the politics surrounding California energy markets, it is unlikely that FERC remove in whole the reporting obligation.
216	Govt Affairs has talked with the West gas team about this new obligation and how we respond.
216	If you have any questions, please call.
216	Jim
217	Makes sense.
217	Jim
218	Please see PG&E response.
218	Jim
219	Thanks for the info.
219	Will be in touch.
219	Jim
220	Jennifer -- Please review and discuss with me if you think there could be "financial" products placed on top of this Utility service - ie, could we get a customer to agree to this and then offer a swap to fix their rate?
220	Jim
221	Fine with me.
221	I finish up with an EES Op Comm meeting at about 10am.
221	Jim
222	Amr- You may want this.
222	Jim
223	Is this our responsive testimony?
223	Jim
224	Becky -- Thanks for the update.
224	I think that maybe you should take 1 hour to walk through the deregulation history of pipelines?
224	Maybe INGAA has some nice history?
224	Jim
225	Amr -- Please take the first stab at two presentations (for each business unit) that would lay out what our key issues and decisionmaking process for these issues.
225	Jim
226	What do I do?
226	Jim
227	I am worried if we give the MM "penalty" ability - especially before the fact.
227	This feels alot like the NYISO implementing some market remedies.
227	FERC can act quickly to abuse if it is found.
227	Jim
228	This gets at some of the buckets of $$ that may or may not be charged to DA.
228	We continue to try and pull together the facts surrounding the potential surcharges to ensure that the book is properly marked.
228	Jim
229	Any way to work on (1) moving to 4/1/02?
229	Jim
230	Steve -- Thanks.
230	Looks good.
230	Some thoughts for you to consider: 1.
230	Not sure that Impact #1 makes sense to present.
230	No real reason to set CTC = 0 c/kwh on Jan 5 (CalPX was still in operation).
230	I think that Impact #2 better captures the idea.
230	Also, probably not good to use the term "CTC Eliminated".
230	Maybe should say "CTC = 0 c/kwh".
230	Given the CPUC's March 27 Order, the Utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until March 31, 2002.
230	2.
230	In calculating Impact #2, what did you use as the Jan 19 - Aug baseline?
230	Did you calculate the hit of ($104.5) from actual bills or based on our DJ Index model (there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline)?
230	Also, I assume that the Feb - Aug timeframe was relatively low because EES and EEMC had most of their load on bundled service.
230	3.
230	Probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for PX Credit calculation and most specifically the PG&E Adjustment.
230	Also, may be interesting to have the $ impact of the PG&E Adjustment (the rate adjustment to re-capture their previous mistake).
230	I think that this is something we need to go into the CPUC to fight pretty quickly.
230	4.
230	Should Impact #4 and Impact #5 apply to SCE's loads?
230	In column 4 it looks like it does.
230	SCE is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge.
230	5.
230	Probably better to model Impact #5 as of Oct 1 not Sept 1.
230	6.
230	Can you break out the volumes for "vintage" contracts versus "retail gen with passthru" contracts?
230	You haven't shown anything for (a) Utility Undercollection costs or (b) CDWR bond fees.
230	These costs may hit our vintage contracts.
230	Jim
231	Pls work into my calendar.
231	Jim
232	I'd be happy to come to the meeting on Sept 5.
232	I'd rather stay close to the bldg for the reception.
232	Jim
233	John -- Look at the letter from CAEM below.
233	They want us to sign on.
233	Not sure that Enron adding its name is the best idea.
233	Also, are the sections listed the right ones?
233	Maybe we can change this without our name.
233	Jim
234	Please process this request.
234	Jim
235	Susan -- Please take the lead on coordinating our response.
235	Thanks.
236	Paul -- How is everything going?
236	Wanted to make sure that I hadn't been unresponsive to the project.
236	Anything critical that you need from me?
236	Please let me know.
236	Jim
237	Agree.
237	Would be good to have the utilities' answer in graphic form (17+ RTOs) versus FERC's model on a side-by-side.
237	Discussion of the TCA work on natural markets to support FERC.
237	Jim
238	Please give me your comments before the meeting.
238	Jim
239	FYI
240	Hey, maybe here for our anniversary.
240	Jim
241	thanks.
242	Thanks.
242	By the way, it is only a "suggestion".
242	I know that I can push pretty hard at times but it's only because I believe that both of you can handle it.
242	You're both doing fabulous jobs.
242	Of everything going on, I never worry about the NE and SE RTO mediations because I know that you guys are going to get everything possible for Enron.
242	Keep up the great job!!!!
242	Thanks for everything, Jim
243	Cool.
243	Sending messages in real-time.
243	Jim
244	Linda -- Pls print out for me.
244	Thx.
245	FYI.
245	California is playing games with the market again.
245	Jim
246	Sweetie -- Here is the address.
246	Scott Karro 200 West 26th Street Apt.
246	PHJ New York, NY 10001 I love you.
246	Jim
247	Info on the SCE response.
247	Jim
248	I wanted to make sure that you had seen the language Jeff references that 1) explicitly recognize the PX Credit as part of Edison's undercollection, and 2) permit Edison to pay debts associated with the negative PX credit in the earlier e-mail.
248	Call me with any questions.
248	Jim
249	Eric -- Please give me a call.
249	I would probably recommend that you sign a new contract with Dick given that we did not intend to renew his option year.
249	Jim
250	I'll discuss tomorrow with Bob.
250	Jim
251	David -- I will cover for meeting and let you know if anything happens.
251	Jim
252	I plan on attending.
252	Jim Steffes
253	Sarah -- Two issues that we should work on -- First Energy discusses CBM (not sure of their position) and MAPSA deals with ICAP.
253	My recollection is that ICAP will not be addressed at this time?
253	Seems to me that we should try and propose some resolution or at a minimum a separate proceeding to mediate this issue before 1/1/03?
253	What do you think?
253	On CBM, now is the time for FERC to get rid of this discriminatory practice.
253	Jim
254	This is the list of the parties opposing the NERTO and their arguments.
254	Jim
255	My only addition would be to strengthen the answer to #5 - RTOs, even if formed, do not explicity resolve the question of the Native Load Exception.
255	I think that this is critical to highlight if this issued is raised.
255	Jim
256	sounds good.
257	Please arrange on my schedule.
257	Jim
258	John - I think that Sue is still on vacation.
258	Jeff may be able to help.
258	Jim
259	Bob -- When should we file our complaint at the CPUC?
259	Jim
260	I wanted IR and PR to be aware that within the next few days the PG&E Bankruptcy team will file with the Judge Enron's current claim.
260	We intend to ask the Judge to Lift the Stay so that we can file at the CPUC a complaint to recoup our current receivable.
260	I'm not sure what our public statements have been and as soon as we prepare the filing, I'll let you know.
260	If anyone has any questions, please give me a call.
260	Thanks, Jim
261	Jamie -- Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities.
261	While I am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neither I nor Enron can sign on to the letter.
261	First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your messages.
261	Enron is a "hot button" in DC and will change the proper focus.
261	In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and Congressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces against competition.
261	Let's not study this too much - we know what to do.
261	Move away from the commission.
261	Also, I'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts.
261	Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.
261	Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.
261	While Enron wants markets that work well, the core problem is that we haven't deregulated enough - not that markets aren't working.
261	Also, I don't know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheney plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.
261	If you want to talk, please let me know.
261	Thanks, Jim
262	Are we sending anyone?
262	Jim
263	Amr -- I'd like this as well.
263	Jim
264	FYI
265	I agree with Bob that the reporting issues are important.
265	I also think that focusing on the "lessons learned" from the NE RTO and SE RTO mediation would be interesting.
265	Have people from different industry groups discussing their views of where the mediations concluded (assuming we are finished by October).
265	Any outstanding issues between EPSA members and between EPSA and other parts of the industry could be discussed.
265	Thanks, Jim
266	No truth from what I know.
267	A couple of points -- 1.
267	The language in the relief indicates that we are trying to "determine the validity and amount of PX Credits owed to EES and EEMC".
267	Is this correct?
267	Isn't our primary goal in this complaint to (a) have the Utility return the net credit to our bills and (b) to allow for recoupment againts all non-generation related charges?
267	2.
267	Throughout the document the idea of "T&D charges" is used.
267	I assume that this is shorthand for all non-generation related charges?
267	We pay CTC and public purpose costs as well as T&D.
267	3.
267	Not sure if CPUC regulates the ESPs.
267	The filing makes this case in the first paragraph.
267	Thanks, Jim
268	Fine.
268	Dick and I have worked out exactly the hours for my group that he will work through mid-Oct.
268	Why not have Dick submit his charges for your group directly to your assistant?
268	Bernadette is in DC and having these charges running around the country may cause great confusion.
268	Finally, since I have not looked at his contract lately, I assume that in using this contract to move forward immediately we are not creating any other obligations with Dick?
268	Thanks, Jim
269	Pat -- Please keep Jean Ryall and Thane Twiggs in the loop on these activities.
269	Specifically, they need to let the desk know before we take any formal actions.
269	Thanks, Jim
270	I was wondering if someone from our trading desk would take the lead?
270	Not necessarily someone from Govt Affairs.
270	Jim
271	Way to go!!!
271	Jim
272	Lisa - I would recommend that you send Mike Day the language to clarify #3.
272	Jim
273	Are we ready?
273	I thought that we were still moving through the process.
273	Jim
274	Harry -- Can you please review and provide input on comments?
274	Especially as it relates to keeping open the San Diego market.
274	Jim
275	See last bill.
275	Jim
276	Jennifer -- Can you get a copy of the SBX2 1 and provide short synopsis?
276	Thanks, Jim
277	Janel got something on this from PRI.
277	Not sure about how much media it got.
277	Jim
278	A short analysis that indicates who would face the brunt of this bill (Enron?) and the mechanism ($/mwh or % of income)?
278	Jim
279	Donna & Becky -- Do you have any good points of reference on the history of natural gas restructuring?
279	Jim
280	I've sent out some feelers on a good book.
280	I'll look around my desk etc. Jim
281	I didn't calendar (or at least I don't remeber).
281	When will this happen?
281	Jim
282	Call Ozzie Pagan.
282	Jim
283	Dave -- With EES' push into serving smaller customers, the issues in this situation -- potential affiliate abuse and unfair sharing of information -- will become more important.
283	When EES focused on national outsourcing, this was less an issue because our products crossed many jurisdictions.
283	This issue, of course, is especially important in recently opened or opening markets as the affiliates try and secure large market share.
283	We are also watching for these activities in places like MI, VA, and OH.
283	Jim
284	We need to let Jeff Richter and Tim Belden understand the implications of this for current book of business.
284	Jim
285	Vicki -- Along with everything else, this bill continues to be discussed.
285	We don't think this is a high probability, but wanted you to be aware (and more importantly, this is California).
285	I'll keep you up to date.
285	Jim
286	Jason -- Dinner is at 5pm at the house.
286	We are catering from Eatzi's.
286	Casual dress is preferred.
286	See you then.
286	Jim
287	Janine -- If we have draft tariff language, I'd push pretty hard.
287	Jim
288	I will be setting up a conference call for later today to discuss our latest view on developments in the California market.
288	If anyone has any specific questions before then, please call me at 713-853-7673.
288	Jim
289	We need a model for the entire Midwest independent of the ability to changeJim
290	2pm works for me.
290	Jim
291	FYI.
291	It would be helpful for you to be on this call.
291	Jim
292	The meeting to discuss California issues today has been set at: EB 8C1
293	FYI
294	FYI
295	FYI.
295	Please coordinate going forward with EPSA.
295	Jim
296	Here is the Proposed Decision.
296	Appreciate any thoughts you have on how to fight or when.
296	Jim
297	Bob -- Pls send Alan the overviews you and Ray put together earlier - thanks.
297	Jim
298	Bob -- Pls update me with all parties Ripple claims on this afternoon's call - Alan you should get on (4:30 Houston time).
298	Jim
299	I want to do this today.
299	Jim
300	Angie - I will be traveling and unable to attend.
300	Hope everyone has a great time.
300	Jim
301	scary.
302	Sue -- What were the figures for the two months prior?
302	Jim
303	I don't understand why you were denied access.
303	Did we improperly file?
303	Call me.
304	Amr & Janel -- Please add these people to your lists.
304	Jim
305	Attached is the complaint that EES intends to file tomorrow against SCE related to the recoupment of our Negative CTC.
305	As you aware, after returning our customers to DA recently, our billing department was expecting that the past Negative CTCs would be returned to our customer's accounts - this has not happened nor after conversations with SCE will it occur.
305	This complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds.
305	Primarily EES does not want to pay for Utility charges for our customers while an outstanding Negative CTC balance is due.
305	One key risk with filing this Complaint is that SCE may consolidate this case with the earlier Complaint that is currently on hold.
305	Probably not too big of a downside.
305	We will be paying the bills into the CPUC for holding until the resolution of the Complaint.
305	Any questions or issues please let me know.
305	Jim
306	With everything else going on, it has been hard to develop the monthly report for ENA management.
306	I'd like to re-start this report and provide an update at the beginning of September.
306	While I am aware of some efforts, I am sure that I don't know about everything that is critical and on-going.
306	I need get a list of projects that your teams are working on for Deal Support, Regulatory Risk, and Advocacy.
306	I am truly at a loss for current deals that Government Affairs is supporting and our expectation of closing dates.
306	For each project, I need lead Government Affairs person, financial impact (our your best guess), background and key issues, and strategies and next steps.
306	This list does not need to be exhaustive, but simply the major activities currently underway.
306	Thanks - I appreciate your help, Jim
307	Alan - Appreciate your thoughts.
307	Jim
308	Thanks for the info.
308	While there may be some differences in presentation, there don't appear to be any basic differences in the analysis.
308	All of the discussions of the legislation need to be aware that the passage is highly uncertain.
308	I agree with the analysis that if you have never been DA and sign up today there is a very large possibility that you will pay a surcharge (assuming the legislation passes).
308	Let me know if there is anything else.
308	Jim
309	cheers.
310	Hope you and Gracie are having a good day!!
310	I miss you guys.
310	California is a difficult State to understand.
310	Things are crazy.
310	Jim
311	Good news or bad news?
311	My quick read is that FERC looks like it is trying to end the obligation but is waiting for an industry solution.
311	What is New Power saying?
311	Jim
312	Bob -- Please be on the next RCR call to update.
312	See Ginger for time.
312	Jim
313	Alan -- Here is the original note for your update.
313	Jim
314	Rick -- I see that Amr has taken over the Fundamentals Group.
314	The fiefdom grows!!!!
314	Jim
315	Angela - The value proposition for a customer is related to which buckets of cost would be bypassed by switching to DA.
315	If a customer goes DA after August 24, 2001 (based on the discussion about surcharges in the legislation that has only passed the Assembly Energy Committee last night - with still a very low probability of success of being signed by the Governor), the customer would pay for SCE undercollection (PG&E isn't being discussed on this piece), DWR bond costs, and DWR net unavoidable.
315	The hardest piece to calculate - which Belden said on the last call he simply couldn't given the tremendous uncertainty - is the DWR net unavoidable.
315	If the customer has been DA since July 1, the customer could avoid the DWR net unavoidable (but the legislation could change or not pass and the CPUC could do something else).
315	Each customer needs to appreciate this latest information and make a determination about what these amounts will be - the key question I'd ask a customer is that they need to try and keep their options open.
315	Of course, all of this assumes that the CPUC doesn't go back and suspend DA even earlier than July 1 or something else crazy happens - remember this is California.
315	Jim
316	Rick -- Any insight into this statement about Whalley and Frevert?
316	I'm guessing that this is just Lay's vision of what is now impacting our company?
316	Appreciate your thoughts?
316	Jim Lay wasn't more specific about the two men's assignments.
316	``They'll be looking at all of the businesses -- the wholesale unit, government affairs.
316	Anything that affects Enron,'' Lay said.
317	Leslie -- Did any of the gas commercial people respond?
317	Also, any communications from ENA and Barry T. on this?
317	Jim
318	thanks.
319	We need to be very cautious about signing on to documents that seek to delay the start date of any RTO - unless and until I hear something different from FERC, my going in assumption is that Enron will be one of the only voices on this issue.
319	We should only give on this issue when real value is being created.
319	Why not file a "me too" on the issue of seating of the Board w/o agreeing to everything else?
319	Jim
320	Agreed.
320	Talk w/ Joe H to confirm that we are consistent with preferred P/L policies.
320	Jim
321	Pls fax to SF office today.
321	Thanks, Jim
322	Leslie -- What would it cost for outside counsel to do the hearing?
322	Maybe running an RCR through with the biggest $$ allows Shapiro, etal to discuss next Tuesday?
322	Jim
323	Jennifer -- SBX2 18 and SBX2 85 are important to follow.
323	Jim
324	I'll be going.
324	You should go if you want to go.
324	It's a good opportunity to network.
324	Jim
325	yes.
326	I think one thing that is good is for every California call you make us go through the key bills in some organized outline.
326	Thanks, Jim
327	Lamar - There is alot of noise in the media to find some customers who will state for the public record that they will be harmed by the retroactive suspension of DA.
327	At one point, you were going to get some customers' names & contact info to pass along to the media.
327	Any luck?
327	Karen Denne with PR is getting quite a few phone calls from California media sources.
327	The strategy has to be to downplay Enron and have the customer pitch "their pain" by this action of the CPUC.
327	Give me or Karen a call.
327	Jim
328	Nancy -- 1.
328	Are we able to vote?
328	2.
328	If yes to #1, what is your recommendation for our vote?
328	Thanks, Jim
329	Alan & Paul -- See John Shelk's e-mail below.
329	Alan, you may want to coordinate.
329	Jim
330	Steve -- I will be traveling back from CA tomorrow so I can't make the call.
330	Some things to be aware of -- We filed Aug 30 before the CPUC asking the CPUC to re-instate our customer net bill amounts.
330	Jeff Dasovich will call John Fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case (or at least delay until after legislative session).
330	If complaint moves forward, SCE will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes.
330	Enron is preparing similar filing for PG&E, although we need to seek Relief from the Stay.
330	2.
330	California Legislation SCE MOU bill (that includes DA issues) moved Aug 29 through Assembly Energy Committee.
330	Needs to go to Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.
330	Hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week.
330	By removing the conservation easements, the bill has lost some liberal Democrats.
330	Governor Davis is asking Business to find 15+ Republicans to move the bill.
330	Trying to modify (1) surcharge effective date to Sept 1+ and (2) get more comfort that SCE will pay our Negative CTC if $$ exists.
330	Also, the Windfall Profits bill has moved through Assembly Committee.
330	It has to go through Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.
330	Jennifer Thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached.
330	Litigation about both Subpeonas was heard this week in SF and Sacramento.
330	Mike Kirby believes that he may have swayed the Court in the Sen Dunn to provide a protective order.
330	A final decision may be issued next week.
330	4.
330	FERC Refund Case Enron presented its "ripple" claim earlier this week.
330	Range of refunds (non-netted) is very large (please see Bob Frank for exact $$).
330	I have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by Alan Comnes.
330	Oral testimony is being prepared in PNW case for next week.
330	Both proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the ALJ issues a recommendation next week (or soon thereafter).
330	Looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single NE RTO energy market is Nov 03 (PJM thinks it can happen by May 03 but wants some cushion).
330	Sarah Novosel is trying to best position us vis-a-vis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier.
330	Also, ICAP and control area consolidation is not considered at this time.
330	Christi Nicolay believes that the ALJ will recommend moving toward a PJM model.
330	6.
330	CPUC Decision to Suspend DA Retroactive Sue Mara continues to push the CPUC to remove the retroactive date in the current Proposed Decision.
330	Some rumors that the CPUC will again delay a decision until Sept 13 (confirming so please keep close).
331	Vicki -- FYI.
331	This bill continues to move.
331	Jennifer Thome prepared this synopsis.
331	Please let me know if you need anything else.
331	I'll ask Jennifer to keep you updated on any changes and status.
331	Jim
332	Sounds like flying Sunday night.
332	Jim
333	Charles -- If the RTO has the Interchange function, what else is needed for "virtual" consolidation?
333	Jim
334	Not too sure how important, but wanted everyone to see the discussion from Jamie Wimberley at CAEM.
334	Jim
335	Jamie -- Thanks for the external view on legislation.
335	I agree that most of the bills don't "get it right" - the hope is that the FERC can do that without too much legislative guidance (which of course would be wrong).
335	Not sure that setting up a new federalism on this will ever work - not enough $$ to states to get them to overcome the political power of the utilities.
335	Jim
336	thanks.
337	Susan -- When we get to a point to make comments, please let me know.
337	Jim
338	No. Just wanted your thoughts.
338	Thanks.
339	I'd say we want tariff language before any investigation.
339	I don't typically like investigations.
339	I like complaints.
339	My thought is to pre-sell tariff changes to FERC with a broad coalition and then get the Ohio PUC to ask FERC the question.
339	Jim
340	Jean -- You may want to call Jeff and find out where he is going with this talk?
340	We still need to meet with a detailed plan on Texas.
340	Maybe next week or soon thereafter.
340	Jim
341	John -- To your point #3Burr -- Probably want to bring in Steve Montovano on the NC PUC question -- we have worked with a local lawyer in the past (I think her name is Allison Duncan) that could help with this question and demonstrate that having an RTO does NOT make a state deal with retail competition any sooner than it wants to deal with the question.
341	Steve Montovano could probably be of assistance here.
341	Maybe bring in Allison to DC to deal directly with the staff?
341	Jim
342	I am not sure if we have a claim to "PX Credits".
342	Our claim is to the negative residual of Bundled less the PX Credit = Negative CTC.
342	Jim
343	Ray -- FYI.
343	Some information on how we are talking about the claims in the Bankrupcty case.
343	Jim
344	It's on my calendar.
344	Unless I need to be in California, I'll go to DC.
344	Jim
345	Janel -- This paper has two great maps that highlight the Utilities' model for RTOs and the FERC's current proposal.
345	Would be great to build this into some DC and other political coverage.
345	Jim
346	Did our $MM Supreme Court attorneys have any heartburn?
346	Jim
347	Here is the file.
347	While there are some quotes, remember that the analytics were never taken to the final decimal.
347	We were mainly trying to make a political point.
347	Jim
348	Jean -- What is Doug going to say?
348	Do we have the right messages?
348	What about the retail issues in Texas?
348	Have we considered these?
348	Jim
349	Vicki & Evan -- Please see the e-mail trail below.
349	The PAPUC has assessed EES $147,000 for its costs.
349	We intend to protest.
349	Do you have any idea of who this bill would go to?
349	Jim
350	Tom -- There does appear to be some intelligence gathering going on at the CPUC.
350	You should speak with legal about the inquiry.
350	Clearly the CPUC has a right to ask anything they want - it is my understanding is that our customers have a confidentiality clause in their contract that prohibits them from responding.
350	Jim
351	thanks
352	While I appreciate the concerns about the diffferences in East and West, we've waited too long for utilities to agree to make RTOs happen.
352	We can finesse this forever, but we need to give FERC some tools to force the process.
352	Jim
353	yes
354	Sue, Mike, & Jeanne -- Attached is the letter from PG&E regarding our payment "issues".
354	Discussions this morning have this gameplan - 1.
354	file at CPUC and Bankruptcy the appropriate paper & $ to hold our issues.
354	We need to have a call at 12 Houston time to discuss and ensure that the filings are consistent.
354	If anyone has any problems, please let me know.
354	Jim
355	Ray -- These are being finalized today for filing tomorrow.
355	I'll send you final.
355	Jim
356	Is there a room inside Enron?
356	Jim
357	Christi's call.
358	Lamar -- It is critical that every customer in California that switched (signed new or renewal customer) during this year.
358	We need a contact person for each account.
358	The key to securing a better date is to have the customers push the Governor and the Legislature and the CPUC.
358	We are able to provide phone numbers and contacts through our trade groups.
358	Jim
359	Looks like we need to make sure that this NERC / RTO policy dispute gets identified and recognized as what it is - discrimination.
359	Jim
360	Great plan.
360	Are we discussing today at 4 DC time?
360	Jim
361	Linda - Pls print attachment.
361	Jim
362	Please feel free to attend.
362	Jim
363	Yes there has been a shift in the thinking - away from the "natural gas" model and toward the financial structure.
363	Some of this is related to the political realities of the US market and FERC.
363	Some is that our traders in the East are comfortable with PJM and have been making term markets at PJM West hub.
363	All of this assumes that we should be able to migrate to a more physical model if the industry needs to later.
363	I do think that it would be helpful for you to get together and work up a discussion for all Government Affairs to explain the key differences and what policy discussions we need to focus upon - (i.e., setting up good "hubs" and auctioning transmission rights).
363	Also, I think that any thoughts you have on the implications for EES are important.
363	Not sure that either model is really "great" for competitive retailers.
363	The difficulty is that our predictions of load and the actual usage will always be different.
363	As long as (1) our analytics have the data to "price" basis between hubs and from a hub to a customer and (2) there is no discrimination in allocation of transmission rights then our ability to sell at retail will be competitive.
363	Jim
364	Please put on my calendar.
364	Also, how do I find out how much vacation I have?
364	Jim
365	I heard today that Brad Nebergald will take over the ILL market under Greg Adams.
365	I'll try and track down all the facts.
365	Jim
366	Don -- Can you please add Becky Cantrell, Melinda Pharms, and Guillermo Canovas to your Nat Gas weekly discussions?
366	Not sure if they will all come, but I'd like someone from Government Affairs at the meeting to try and keep us up-to-date on the issues.
366	Jim
367	Please put on my calendar.
367	Jim
368	Fine.
368	Same here.
368	Jim
369	Steve & Rick -- FYI.
369	PG&E Bankruptcy counsel has provided the below stipulation that holds any further action on this issue for 48 hours.
369	It appears that PG&E doesn't want to be anywhere near the CPUC.
369	Provide more details as they go through.
369	Jim
370	Please do not contact these customers.
370	FYI, Enron signed the following customers after July 1 (we are checking on Wal-Mart).
370	I would like Bev and Hedy to rank these parties with their ability to help in Sacramento with our messaging.
370	Once you have this, let's talk this afternoon to plan going forward.
370	As you can see from the e-mail, we are going to have to work through our business people.
370	Jim
371	Sent the wrong address first time.
371	Jim
372	not sure.
372	it was stated rather quickly in passing.
373	FYI.
373	Same holds - let's not talk to Wal-Mart until we work through our business folks.
373	Jim
374	Thanks.
374	Jim
375	Linda -- Please arrange a call-in number for 10:30 am Houston time for everyone above for tomorrow.
375	Purpose - Legislative Strategy.
375	Thanks.
375	Jim
376	Becky-- Please keep Guillermo and Melinda in the loop.
376	Jim
377	Next Steps -- 1.
377	Leverage EES Customers Signing Post August 25 Contracts The language in SB78 continues to hold the date for suspending DA as August 25.
377	EES signed a number of very large contracts that benefit important in-state businesses.
377	We are trying to establish a strategy around the following segments: a) California Restaurant Association b) CMTA via the Aerospace Industry We need all of our customers to call (a) the Governor, (b) the key Legislative members, and (c) their trade associations.
377	Leveraging the trade associations is critical given CMTA's support for the bill.
377	We can release (very quietly) to influential persons Wal-Mart, Raytheon, and Northrop.
377	It is also critical that we try and contact someone from Boeing to get their read of the bill and its impact.
377	Our understanding is that they have recently signed a deal with another marketer and will be cut out by this Bill.
377	Any help in communicating with Boeing is critical.
377	Please let me know how best to approach the Calif Rest Association.
377	What should we do?
377	Is it better to have our customers call?
377	I will work up some talking points and phone numbers with Sue Mara to use in these discussions.
377	2.
377	Fight the CPUC on Retroactive Order Sue Mara is working through AReM to convince the CPUC that their Proposed Decision would be illegal.
377	Continue to push on this front.
377	Thanks, Jim
378	Great.
378	Really appreciate.
378	Jim
379	Before we invite FERC staff to the trading floor, let's set up a gameplan and run by the trading floor - I don't want a dispute with trading after inviting staff down here.
379	Jim
380	Sarah & Alan -- I plan on attending.
380	Both of you should feel free.
380	I think that right now we should decline any offer to present unless we can come up with a set of "Guiding Principles" (i.e., prospective market rules, etc.) Jim
381	FYI.
381	Please keep this confidential.
381	Jim
382	Do we want to "represent" EPSA on the Friday panel?
382	Jim
383	Did all of the amendments pass the Appropriations Comm?
383	When will a new bill get printed?
383	Jim
384	Paul & Alyse -- If we need help, Sarah is interested.
384	My recollection is that we had filled the slots.
384	Please let me know.
384	Jim
385	John -- Do you know when Enron started discussions with these customers?
385	Jim
386	Pls print and hold for my Thurs meeting.
386	Thanks, Jim
387	Please see me.
388	Ok.
388	How about breakfast on Thursday?
388	Jim
389	Hope -- I will be attending the Board Meeting.
389	Sorry I am so late.
389	Linda Noske will be finalizing my plans.
389	Thanks, Jim
390	Jim -- I was wondering if you would like to meet with Alan Comnes and me to discuss your thoughts on market power mitigation on Thursday, Sept 13 at 7:30am in DC?
390	Let me know.
390	Alan and I are in DC for some other discussions.
390	Jim
391	Lynne -- This appears fine.
391	Thanks.
391	Jim
392	Lamar -- I have received the list of the clients from John McMullen.
392	The key push is Legislative and AReM PR is not involved.
392	We need the customers to call the Gov and key Legislators.
392	Jim
393	Here is another file.
394	Should we include Becky Cantrell on these calls?
394	Jim
395	Harry -- I think that this makes alot of sense.
395	I like working through AReM on this as much as possible.
395	When is the next deadline?
395	Jim
396	Include on the report.
396	Jim
397	Jeff -- See below.
397	Does this fit into Mary's responsibilities?
397	Let me know.
397	Jim
398	For the report.
399	Ray -- Wanted to make sure that you had seen the note Sanders sent around?
399	I think that we should discuss today on the 4:30 call.
399	Jim
400	Please make sure this discussion is incorporated into the Monthly Report
401	Ray -- I think that this is about the CalPX bankruptcy.
401	Any issues?
401	Can you please get with PGE to make sure we are on the same page?
401	Jim
402	Any other news?
402	Jim
403	Bryan -- a.
403	A good resource for you.
403	b.
403	Also, if anything is intersting, may want to add.
403	Key would be MI, NV, and VA discussions.
403	Jim
404	Pls include on the report.
404	Jim
405	Do you want to do this?
405	Jim
406	Pls include on the Monthly Report
407	Pls incorporate as appropriate into our presentation.
407	Jim
408	I will be out of town.
409	Here are the other files.
409	Jim
410	Per our conversation today -- 1.
410	Sue Mara is working with AReM to (a) work on an alternative vehicle for DA - the Bowen bill, (b) get the "taking" argument for retroactive CPUC action to Norm Plotkin and Richard Katz, (c) call APS Energy Services to motivate Boeing, (d) getting AReM active on the date issue.
410	By the way, Sue Mara heard that the CPUC has received "hundreds" of letters related to the CPUC decision.
410	2.
410	Everyone should be working to get customers focused on messaging to the (a) Governor's office and (b) trade associations.
410	KEY MESSAGES: 1.
410	Don't have the CPUC Make Wrong Decision Tomorrow 2.
410	SB78 can work if DA Suspension Date = Sept 1.01 or Later 3.
410	Setting this DA Suspension Date Does NOT Mean that Customers Will Escape Fair Surcharges I am putting together a gameplan right now for who to call and the messages.
410	3.
410	I called Sandra Yamane (at Marathon Communications) re: CEO contacts.
410	Once I receive the list, we'll make a decision on how to proceed with that group.
410	4.
410	Hedy is working to get Hertzberg (and any others) to call the CPUC and seek another delay.
410	5.
410	Mike Day - can you please draft language to use on the Assembly floor to "fix" SB78 per our interests.
410	Hedy & Bev, who should support the amendment?
410	Don't we need a member to carry the provision?
410	Wouldn't it be better if we had CMTA or the CA Restaurant Association?
410	Is this possible?
410	6.
410	Scott Govenar is calling Boeing's lobbyist to get them "interested".
410	Thanks everybody.
410	Keep up the great work!!!
410	Jim
411	For the Monthly Update.
412	On coalitions, I was thinking about other market participants.
412	Agreed that Cinergy could be the vehicle.
412	Also, maybe make an informal presentation to FERC before any filing, etc. Jim
413	FYI.
413	These bills are currently moving through the California Legislature.
413	Not sure if the bills will be signed into law.
413	Please call with any questions.
413	From my quick glance, only good news is that it appears that the Windfall Profits Tax would not apply to retail contracts in effect on date of enactment.
413	Jim
414	Bryan - Pls include on the Monthly update.
414	Jim
415	Lisa -- Rick Shapiro has offered to present.
415	I think that we can work up some presentation for 45 minutes.
415	Let's discuss soon the details.
415	It is on his calendar.
415	Jim
416	The latest information we have -- President Lynch of the CPUC said today that the vote on suspending DA would be taken tomorrow.
416	Proposed Decision remains at suspending as of July 1.
416	There is still a possibility that the CPUC will hold this vote.
416	In addition, there continues to be a legislative fix that could override this decision.
416	Please call with any questions.
416	Jim
417	Fine.
417	Jim
418	Michele & Rick -- Please see the note below.
418	It is critical for you to call your clients (Jack in the Box/Burger King and Wendy's) to try and convince them to push their industry lobbyist to ask for a change in the date.
418	Call me at 713-853-7673 or 713-851-2499 (cell) to discuss.
418	Thanks, Jim
419	I've asked Sue Mara to try and develop through AReM some form of legal action that the industry could file if the CPUC goes through with its current plans to retroactively suspend DA as of July 1.
419	Our goal should be to file tomorrow evening (assuming CPUC action).
419	To make sure that we are on board, it probably makes sense to have a phone call to discuss the draft sometime tomorrow early afternoon (1pm PST?).
419	I will leave it to Sue Mara to arrange with the people on this e-mail a conference call to discuss the draft.
419	My choice would be to not have Enron file the paper, but rather work through AReM.
419	Thanks, Jim
420	Linda -- Can you please get a copy of the report below "Spending Wisely on Private Hubs" for me?
420	If it costs $$, I don't want it.
420	Thanks.
420	Jim
421	Jennifer - Please make sure that Vicki gets regular updates of both bills.
421	Thanks.
421	Jim
422	Christi -- Fine work.
422	Looks like we are moving forward in the SE.
422	A couple of discussion points.
422	I am still not so much in love the LMP as this paper makes it seem you are (I don't believe there is a perfect solution).
422	Also, the document is not consistent relating to Control Area consolidation.
422	For instance, the issue around CA or RTO with tagging makes no sense if there is only one CA - the RTO.
422	This is important to highlight to the ALJ.
422	The easiest way to solve the problem is to do away with the archaic systems of the old world.
422	Also, I still don't fully understand why we are happy that the SAC gets to pick the IMA.
422	I personally despise the concept of a SAC - never has worked when times get tough.
422	Also, no real discussion (or maybe I missed) of timing to implement - next phase?
422	Anyway, great work in the mediation.
422	Keep pushing these guys from the South.
422	Thanks, Jim
423	Thought you should see this.
423	Jim
424	Should we talk about the implications for the PX Credit given this PD?
424	I am guessing that this would significantly alter the calculation for PG&E - moving DWR from $60 to $140.
424	Do we want to file comments on how this should than resolve the PX Credit process?
424	Jim
425	I wanted to re-confirm that you are covering?
425	Thanks, Jim
426	Please set up a meeting on Monday with Becky.
426	Thanks
427	This guy runs a small think tank / TV and radio program that tries to push competitive ideas.
427	He is very pro telecom and energy dereg.
427	Not sure if this is something that makes alot of sense for Enron, but thought I'd get your spin.
427	I'll follow up with you.
427	Jim
428	Thanks for the material.
428	I am discussing internally.
428	Will keep confidential.
428	Jim
429	Good info.
429	I like the Reg Orig plays.
429	Amr should track our success.
429	Jim
430	Jim -- I'll be staying downtown.
430	Once I finalize my plans, I'll get in touch to finalize our meeting.
430	You're right about our thinking - probably just to get a feel for some ideas, nothing formal.
430	Thanks, Jim
431	Lisa -- I don't have any funds for this.
431	Sorry.
431	Jim
432	Christi -- I am comfortable with trying to settle.
432	I hate that this new Commission has to litigate this case.
432	It is important, however, that we focus FERC staff on the broader policy changes necessary throughout the industry and not just on Entergy's tariff.
432	Jim
433	Hi Sweetie -- Out here in California.
433	Trying to rally support for competition.
433	Hope you and Grace are having a good day.
433	I love you, Jim
434	Thanks.
434	Jim
435	David -- Here is some info the Windfall Profits.
435	Jennifer can keep you updated.
435	Jim
436	Please review first section.
436	Jim
437	Jose - thanks.
437	Also, feel free to send to JoAnn Hill in Houston.
437	Jim
438	Susan -- Please put in an RCR to discuss ASAP (probably next week).
438	I think that the key issue involves the inclusion of financial transactions.
438	Need a solid message from industry that this is inappropriate - which EPSA members are filing this info?
438	Jim
439	Some thoughts from Bob Williams.
439	Jim
440	Please let the right person know that I will be on vacation.
440	Jim
441	Thanks.
441	Fully agree.
441	I figure Sarah's already committed to #2.
441	Jim
442	thanks.
443	Please include Becky Cantrell in this meeting.
443	Jim
444	Your call.
445	Let's set up the meetings.
445	Don't you think?
445	Jim
446	Scott -- Good to hear you were ok.
446	Let us know if you need anything.
446	I'm stuck in DC right now and trying to get home.
446	Jim
447	Great.
448	I agree that we are losing money.
448	That's not the reason for getting out of this case.
448	What is the upside?
448	Even if we win, we are only forcing FERC to reconsider at some later time.
448	Is this really the best strategy?
448	Jim
449	Yes.
449	I had called him to set up a meeting.
449	We talked recently in PA when he told me he was taking the job.
449	I'll arrange lunch (if everyone wants to) soon.
449	But don't delay talking with him.
449	He wants as much help from Enron as possible.
449	Jim
450	Good to hear from you!!!!
450	I hope all of your family is well.
450	I was in DC on Tuesday am and drove in last night.
450	Jim
451	No known timeline yet.
451	I'm still discussing internally.
451	Jim
452	Ok.
452	But let's keep the time and $ minimal.
452	Jim
453	John -- Thanks for the update.
453	As long as the FERC is fully in control and the ERO is not a "self-regulating" organization, I assume we'd be ok.
453	The ERO must be fully under the control of FERC.
453	Jim
454	Sue -- Please work with Diann to determine if their calculations are tariff driven or simply an internal process of SCE.
454	Thanks, Jim
455	FYI
456	Rogers -- FERC has already filed a policy statement providing for cost recovery of "security" upgrades assuming they are reasonable.
456	I know that the Bush Admin will now have the response as its top priority.
456	I think that it will take a couple of weeks before we really understand the implications for further energy reform.
456	FERC postponed announcing its Work Plan this week but my guess is that Chairman Wood will continue down his course.
456	Retail competition in different states was already under fire from the California situation.
456	Not sure if this week's events will have any major changes.
456	Thanks.
457	Christi -- Let's talk.
457	We are arguing against NERC, but Kevin needs to understand that something must be in its place.
457	We have a policy that we are supporting - giving reliability to FERC - and that is Enron's approach.
457	Have you communicated that to Kevin?
457	Also, on RPS and energy source reporting, I agree but this may be a part of the final package.
457	Also, the language I read allows the FTC to construct a process that makes it possible to not use day ahead markets.
457	Jim
458	Attached please find Sept's Government Affairs report.
458	If you would like to discuss, please let me know.
458	Thanks, Jim
459	Sue -- Here is the list of key customers in CA that may support our efforts.
459	Please work with Tom Riley to coordinate.
459	Jim
460	Steve -- If you have not called SCE yet, now may be a good time to do so (given the failure of the Legislature to resolve their problems).
460	Jim
461	yes.
462	I intend to produce this monthly.
462	We had been doing it before.
462	If you have any questions about the matters included, please call.
462	Jim
463	Elizabeth -- I'd like to let Bryan take over this project.
463	Jim
464	Ray -- I assume this makes sense and you are incorporating into the case?
464	Jim
465	Diann -- I was under the impression that we had taken all necessary steps to protect our customers?
465	Is this problem just related to residential customers?
465	Jim
466	Not sure if there is much to do.
466	I was just sending this e-mail because I saw Alan working to find a copy as well as John Shelk's team - wanted to make sure we weren't duplicating efforts.
466	Jim
467	It sounds better on FM - you can pick up the wonderful vocals.
467	Didn't hear too much from Rush on the drive - he was probably in a bunker worried that the Taliban was after him.
467	Jim
468	More info.
469	Christi -- When is this meeting?
469	Also, Dave Forester is looking for someone to present (through Rick Shapiro call).
469	Is this the same meeting?
469	Call me.
469	Jim
470	He is at the State Dept. Glad to hear things are well.
470	Jim
471	Thanks for the info.
471	Jim
472	Thanks.
472	Pls send out.
472	Jim
473	Diann -- So it is correct to say that EES is responsible for the final bills?
473	If yes, how much $$ is this?
473	Jim
474	Anthony & Evan -- Who should process this?
474	Jim
475	I'm ok with this.
475	Jennifer will be good for RTO campaign.
475	Jim
476	When: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 4:30 PM-5:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
477	Alan -- 1.
477	Is Sue Mara going with you?
477	Who else is going?
477	Anyone from commercial or scheduling?
477	My understanding is that Ray Alvarez is attending?
477	2.
477	Do we have a list of issues that we want to go through with the CAISO?
477	Maybe outlining our Top Ten before the meeting and getting internal agreement (maybe even with the other participants) makes sense?
477	Thanks
478	Guys -- Don't know if we need to do our own study.
478	Probably want to get with this prof to discuss.
478	I agree with his analysis that the electricity markets needs a bunch of sellers - means we should push for distributed generation.
478	Thanks
479	Linda -- Yesterday you mentioned I had a small work assignment during the meeting.
479	Didn't get the exact details.
479	Any info is appreciated.
479	Jim
480	Charles -- Please work with Susan Lindberg on this as well.
480	Jim
481	I only have one question - the NYISO may be replaced by a NERTO as soon as this year in December.
481	What is the timeframe of the contract?
481	Also, the NYISO rules may change - what happens to our deal?
481	Do we have rights to restructure?
481	What happens if ICAP or UCAP goes away as an obligation?
481	Jim
482	I'll be on holiday during this time frame.
482	Don't wait for me.
482	Jim
483	Not sure if there is any real "issue" we can push.
483	Maybe something on the P/L side (see Joe Hartsoe).
483	Clearly this idea that RTOs will be anti-security is mistaken - it just implies that there should be redundancy of systems.
483	Jim
484	Bryan -- Add this to the report database.
484	THanks.
484	Jim
485	Susan -- Jim
486	Does change in law mean the implementation of the NE RTO?
486	That process is underway and whatever happens with its implementation we should already have a knowledge of?
486	Jim
487	Call Thane Twiggs.
487	I'd also be interested in seeing this through - there was a little confusion about Enron's position earlier but we are now ok.
487	Jim
488	Tammy -- I sent this report to John and Louise last week.
488	Intend to make it monthly.
488	Similar to earlier.
488	I will include you on it going forward.
488	Sent to John's asst.
488	Call with any questions.
488	Jim
489	Is this good or bad for Enron?
489	My take is that this doesn't help us push for ONE RTO.
489	Jim
490	Please add to Reg Orig section.
490	Jim
491	Don't know where you guys are with the negotiations, but here is another small issue with PG&E that would be nice to work through with them.
491	Jim
492	Michael - I've asked the outside consultants to give us a % change for the impact of the refund case.
492	Try to give these to you asap.
492	Ray Alvarez will you please follow up with CRA and Jan Acton?
492	Thanks, Jim
493	thanks.
494	I think that this list is fine.
494	Any thoughts to including the key Industrial customer and legal rep for the Munis / Coops while in this area?
494	Jim
495	Sounds good to me.
495	Any thoughts to have Milnthorp support the Conservatives and Devries (or someone else) do the Liberals?
495	Jim
496	Should we try and agree with the other market participants on a list of issue prior to the meeting?
496	Maybe coordination also with FERC staff prior to the meeting?
496	Don't want to appear that this is "ganging up" but we do need to be prepared to go in with a clear idea of what is a "good" meeting.
496	Jim
497	too late.
498	I will be attending.
498	Jim
499	Christi -- Like we spoke about yesterday, the key play here will be to understand the retail opportunities.
499	Let me know how your efforts to get a good synopsis goes.
499	Don't forget to use Jennifer Thome to help in this effort.
499	Jim
500	thanks for the reply.
500	we will be reviewing the applications in due course.
500	probably best to work through the standard process.
501	Becky -- FYI.
501	Does EGM have any past advocacy on NURF?
501	Jim
502	I'd let Alan make the call.
502	As long as we understand the issues well, maybe no reason to take commercial to the mtg.
502	Jim
503	A couple of thoughts -- 1.
503	Ashley Brown and Rick have a great relationship.
503	Don't hesitate to use Rick to find out some details if you need him.
503	2.
503	Are we supporting this?
503	I don't understand why we would agree to make NG the MM with this process / paper?
503	Thanks.
504	Howard - Have you and Jeff Brown talked about the MG deal?
504	I want to make sure that you understand fully and appreciate any issues / concerns.
504	Thanks.
505	Do we need to have a phone call with you, Harry K., Charles Y., Sarah N., Christi N., John Shelk, Gloria O., Vinio Flores to make sure that Enron is on the same page?
505	I don't think that we will see much support from the business people, although maybe you and I can sit down with Evan Hughes to get his buy-in.
505	Let me know.
505	Jim
506	Do we need to have a meeting to work through this?
506	What outside counsel is supporting the sale right now?
506	Jim
507	Dan - Spoke with Janet Dietrich yesterday.
507	Slight change to our advocacy versus our Monday discussions.
507	After meeting with Sean Holmes, it was agreed that our policy work would say (1) no retroactive DA suspension (at least not earlier than Sept 1), (2) don't end DA but study how to allow it to continue.
507	If the CPUC does suspend without retroactive, the fear is that re-starting the CA market will be very difficult.
507	Please call me when you get some time.
507	Jim
508	Thanks.
508	As long as the business guys (and King & Spalding) aren't preventing the appropriate filings, I'll assume this deal is done.
508	Jim
509	Thanks.
509	Does Howard understand your deal and the going-forward issues (if any) that he needs to be aware of?
509	I want to make sure that he knows what is important and unimportant to this (and other load curtailment).
509	Jim
510	Paul -- Please give me a call (if possible today).
510	I am taking vacation from tomorrow through next week Friday.
510	Jim
511	Linda -- Pls put on my calendar.
511	Thanks, Jim
512	Bob -- Did we send this?
512	Jim
513	EEI's work is nothing more than the NERC language (but shorter).
513	Still the key difference - self-regulating versus standard setting.
513	Given that EEI seems to believe that the Canadian issues are minor, why get rid of the self-regulating nature?
513	Jim
514	Becky -- Thanks for the updated list.
514	I will include it in our database.
514	Please continue to coordinate with Roy Boston on the "info" reporting.
514	Jim
515	Linda -- Please set up some time (about 1 hour) after I return from my vacation with Dave Duran and Rick Shapiro and myself to discuss Enron's Wholesale & Retail Advocacy Positions.
515	Thanks.
515	Jim
516	FYI.
516	Please try and attend.
516	Bob, it would be good to have your issue list on the TFG Brief and next steps before the meeting to this group.
516	Jim
517	Bob -- Any concerns with this language?
517	Not sure if we are even going to file, but want to be ready.
517	Sue -- While this draft talks about July 1 retroactive date, I'd guess this would be filed if the CPUC does anything before the Ordering date?
517	Jim
518	Bob -- Jeff talked with Fielder.
518	Your thoughts on next steps?
518	Jim
519	FYI.
520	Janine -- I would have EPMI be the party of record.
520	Also, please make sure that Susan Lindberg gets a copy of all filings to pass along to the Midwest desk.
520	Thanks, Jim
521	on holiday
522	I am trying to find out if anything went out and if so, will be in touch with the document.
522	Jim
523	FYI
524	Richard -- FYI.
525	Please add to the database.
525	Jim
526	Thanks for the informative phone call this morning.
526	Having the key issues presented in one place was very helpful.
526	To follow up on the meeting, the following are action items for the group.
526	1.
526	December 1 Market Readiness Update Meeting Thane Twiggs (wholesale) and Nancy Hetrick (retail) will have at this time an understanding of the billing and settlement issues (or not) with their respective areas.
526	We need to ensure that EES and EPMI are able to get the necessary information to make sure that their bills and settlements are working and that we can bill our retail customers.
526	I will ask Linda Noske to set up this meeting.
526	If anyone hears anything else about the market delay, please let Jean Ryall know immediately.
526	As of right now, it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled???
526	2.
526	Congestion Pass thru to EES' Retail Customers Thane Twiggs, Nancy Hetrick and Jim Steffes will get with EWS and EES counter parties to try and work through the ability of EES passing thru congestion to its customers per the contract language.
526	I will lead the process of consulting with EES legal.
526	3.
526	Wholesale Issues (Thane Twiggs) a.
526	Define workable TCR Product b.
526	End Balanced Schedule requirement c.
526	Fix Capacity Auction process, including credit matters e.
526	Settlement & Billing 4.
526	Retail Issues a.
526	REP - ISO - Utility Interface (Nancy Hetrick) b.
526	Reliant PTB (Pat Keene) d.
526	Reliant Negative CTC (Pat Keene) e.
526	TXU Negative CTC (Pat Keene) 5.
526	Information Flow All policy statements from anyone within Government Affairs should be first vetted with Jean Ryall to ensure consistency and conformity.
526	Also, all people on the TO: list above should be included on all e-mail traffic.
526	I know this may sometimes slow down response to business people, but I think that we can all agree that no one has all the information in this very fast moving environment and unless we have a central clearinghouse we may send the wrong messages.
526	It is also critical that all commercial people interested in Texas need to hear about the latest.
526	By having Jean Ryall in the center, she will be able to ensure that no one feels "cut out".
526	The bi-weekly meeting should be held with Jean Ryall as Host to follow these issues in a timely manner.
526	6.
526	Wholesale Products Thane Twiggs was going to keep the team apprised of our products and pricing info on a regular basis so we are informed about the market.
526	Finally, it is critical that everyone work together to get the best results possible for Enron in the Texas market.
526	This is our "home" base - we need to make sure that our business efforts win big.
526	Thanks for everything ya'll have been doing to achieve this result.
526	Jim
527	Beth -- Who on your team can I get to move forward with this report?
527	Jim
528	PLEASE INCLUDE THIS INFORMATION.
528	Jim
529	Vicki -- I have heard recently that EES is signing up customers in Texas that "passes thru" congestion.
529	There may be some billing and settlement issues given ERCOT's systems.
529	Basically, we will not know based on our bill from ERCOT what each customer's congestion was.
529	I want to make sure that EES billing can determine how to charge this?
529	Who should I talk with?
529	Jim
530	Leslie -- Please let me know what you need to get this issue properly defined by EES.
530	One option, maybe, would be to take the customers back to sales service.
530	Would there be any problems with this?
530	Please let me know.
530	Jim
531	Bryan -- Please include the first 3 on the Regulatory Ventures section for next month.
531	Jim
532	Sarah -- Please pound EPSA into submission on the NE RTO.
532	Jim
533	Becky-- I spoke with Don Black.
533	Please work with Donna Greif to get this done.
533	She is responsible according to Don.
533	Also, if possible so we don't have to rush our IT and pay extra money, what about asking FERC to give us a 15 day delay for filing.
533	Probably just file to do it and ask for forgiveness.
533	Thanks, Jim
534	FYI.
534	Use as necessary.
535	Linda & Sarah -- Please get with Jean to discuss.
535	I don't think that Enron needs to send this right now with everything else.
535	Jim
536	CONFIDENTIAL -- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE OUTSIDE THE COMPANY.
536	Attached is a spreadsheet of how prices may change with the FERC Refund case.
536	This is still subject to change.
536	Hope this helps with the Negative CTC calculation and negotiations.
536	Jim
537	Good memo.
538	Thanks.
538	Keep up the good work.
538	Jim
539	Becky -- I hope that I didn't come across too strongly just now.
539	Our budget is again under fire by the business groups and I want to try and do everything we can to create value for the businesses.
539	I appreciate what you are doing on this.
539	Thanks for everything.
539	I understand the bind we are in with timing and the importance of getting this report in to FERC.
539	Jim
540	Jean -- Please take the lead working with Mike D Smith to clarify that we don't have any issues.
540	Thanks, Jim
541	HERE IS THE NEW FILE.
542	What do you think that about having Kerry take the lead on all MAPP area RTOs while also supporting Roan in MISO/ARTO?
542	Not top priority but I think this could be a good opportunity.
542	Jim
543	Your call.
543	I'll support you on whatever you decide.
543	Jim
544	Can we talk about this and a number of other issues tomorrow?
544	I'll try and get Linda Noske to arrange a time.
544	Jim
545	Please get this to Fundamentals.
545	Thanks, Jim
546	Lisa -- You should also attend.
546	Jim
547	Glenn Thomas was the chief guy in the Gov office during PECO but was relatively quiet.
547	He is now the Chair of the PaPUC.
547	He will probably just discuss how wonderful a job PA is doing.
547	I don't think that he'll want to pick on Calif. If you want to talk with him prior to the meeting, I can give him a call or Steve Montovano can arrange something.
547	Jim
548	That's good.
548	Jim
549	Here is the note.
550	FYI.
550	Jim
551	Mike -- EPMI is the QSE.
551	As long as our customers don't mind that we are deciding their congestion charges internally, then this should work.
551	My concern was that our customers would balk at Enron deciding how much of our costs they should pay?
551	Jim
552	Donna -- I'd say that it is a commercial matter.
552	Try and push the bill back.
552	I know that Paul says his RC is closed but someone above him has to have some $$.
552	Jim
553	We need to discuss the economics of this on our book (assuming that these costs hit our pocket and not our customers).
553	Jim
554	Why does Edison care about DWR stranded costs?
554	Are these the costs of the bonds or the above market long-term contracts?
554	Jim
555	Linda & Sarah -- I intend to come to DC tomorrow night and attend the EPMI v. FERC hearing (if I still have a seat).
555	I'm planning on attending the GENI meeting Wed pm and Thurs.
555	Thanks, Jim
556	Thanks for the invite but I'll think the DC team should brief Greg on the beltway politics and energy policy.
556	I'll join you guys at the Supreme Court invitation window.
556	Jim
557	Jim -- How about breakfast on Wednesday this week?
557	I'm coming in tomorrow night and could do breakfast on Wed.
557	Jim
558	Jean -- Is the PUC going to agree on AEP's motion (please see below)?
558	What are we doing to stop this movement?
558	AEP is ready to go in Ohio with the same notice but just haven't done anything in TX.
558	Jim
559	Thanks for keeping Wes and Mary Lynne informed.
559	I give this chance a very low probability right now, but we'll see.
559	Jim
560	Can we change the project lead on the RTO NOPR on Standards of Conduct to be both Lisa Yoho and Leslie Lawner?
560	Also, can you call the project leads before the memo goes out to make sure that they are aware of their responsibilities - just a heads up?
560	In paragraph 2, your language is that this is addressed only to the people on the chart.
560	I think that Rick intends to send out to everyone in GA.
560	Maybe we want to change to indicate that people are welcome to be included in teams if they were not mentioned.
560	Thanks, Jim
561	Jim -- Just trying to follow-up on the next meeting?
561	Any news?
562	Harry & Nancy -- I am somewhat concerned that the implications of having to act as tax collector is creating a push to change the way REPs work with the T&D company.
562	In Enron's advocacy throughout my years, we have always asked the PUCs to make the marketer the "customer of record" - better limits the Utility control over the market.
562	Now it appears that this good decision of the PUCT has tax implications and means that we have to process the taxes.
562	I don't see that trying to support a change is a good thing from our long-run business.
562	Moreover, if we are paying Gross Receipts taxes and didn't include them into our customer costs than we made a mistake.
562	This is a cost of our business.
562	Let's talk.
562	Jim
563	Jo Ann -- Do you know if Dan Staines has an active Employment Contract?
564	Charles -- After our conversation today, I thought that I'd outline some Q&A topics for you to consider -- 1.
564	How does NERC define "security"?
564	(important to differentiate between national security and system security).
564	2.
564	What is NERC's role in national security?
564	3.
564	Will RTOs degrade national security?
564	system security?
564	4.
564	What does Enron think about calls to restrict access to network information such as transmission maps?
564	5.
564	Does Enron oppose additional emphasis on securing electricity infrastructure?
564	This Q&A should not be released to the public.
564	I think this is just to make sure that all of Govt Affairs is on the same page and our DC team has good answers to hard questions.
564	Thanks.
565	I'm on my way to DC.
565	Please ask my asst to set a good time to call with you on Wed.
565	Thanks
566	Unless Jean hears otherwise, I don't think that Enron needs to be doing anything that conflicts with the key policy arrangement on the marketer being the customer of record for the T&D services.
566	Jim
567	What does Mike Roan think??
567	Also, will they help pay for our "natural market study" in the SE??
567	Jim
568	Lisa -- Give me a call about this and Item #1 below.
568	Jim
569	Please print and ensure that Jose Bestard has this info.
569	Jim
570	Have we done my travel for NERC meeting in Vancouver?
570	Jim
571	Looks good.
571	Why doesn't EPSA propose a timeline for the FERC to order?
571	This could be a signal that we only want one "rule change" date.
571	Also, maybe we can build in Kevin's argument about uncertainty hurting liquidity and market dynamics right now.
571	Jim
572	The statements.
572	Jim
573	Rick -- You indicated that NERC disavowed their discussions with the press about national security and RTOs to NB (I may have misheard you).
573	I think these attachments would prove otherwise.
573	Finally, I'm sure that RJ Rudden is just fronting for Southern.
573	Jim
574	Paul -- Can we have a phone call with our Reg team on Friday to make sure that everything is a-ok?
574	I want one final run through.
574	If yes, please let me know by phone and I'll ask Linda Noske to set up the call.
574	Also, I owe you a call on Sue / Jeff.
574	Are you in Thurs?
574	Jim
575	haven't checked voice mail at home - in DC.
575	have time to talk right now on phone?
575	Jim
576	Jeff -- How about a call tomorrow to discuss?
576	Jim
577	FYI.
577	The first memo.
578	Here is my proposed budget.
578	Jim
579	Mike Roan and Tom Hoatson would be the best.
579	Jim
580	Lynnette -- Please talk with Pat Keene about Nevada.
580	Some customers will have access.
580	Jim
581	This is a non-ERCOT Texas utility.
581	Jim
582	Rick -- Belden is in Houston next Wednesday and a number of the Western team is going to visit with him about current status and issues.
582	Also, he wants to get more info on the PJM model.
582	Congress has re-scheduled the hearing on Reliability for the same time.
582	Can you attend the Belden meeting in Houston (Presto is coming for the PJM model discussion)?
582	Jim
583	Dave -- Do we have a strong preference for what DSTAR utilities should do?
583	I think that we want to communicate with OMTR and others at FERC to push a single RTO in the West (leaving CA) outside.
583	Also, having the Transco originally within the RTO West makes alot of operational sense and should not limit the economics of the Transco.
583	Jim
584	Rick -- Please see attached.
584	Lot's of $$ from CA.
584	Jim
585	Thanks Dave.
585	The critical things for us to take-away are the key priorities for the Desk moving forward.
585	On this, I want to make sure that Kevin and Tim are comfortable with the evolving process of implementing RTOs - Option 1: wait till completely ready or Option 2: start with basic and "improve".
585	Thanks, Jim
586	Becky -- My only question is one of emphasis.
586	Are points 3&4 the key for Barry T.?
586	If so, should we move them up higher?
586	Also, why the very lenghthy discussion of pooling points?
586	The length makes the points after that discussion hard to appreciate.
586	Maybe a list of bullet points up front?
586	Jim
587	Should we add a Project titled "Interconnection NOPR" for Susan Lindberg?
587	Jim
588	Susan -- Can we sit down tomorrow or Monday for 30 minutes to discuss.
588	Maybe at 11am Friday.
588	Want to get an idea of the timing and our position.
588	Thanks, Jim
589	Please put on my calendar and arrange travel/hotel.
589	Thanks
590	Mary -- As we discussed, please find a list of our project team leads on on-going wholesale matters.
590	Thanks, Jim
591	Could you please find out what group Carlos works with and pass him some information?
591	Thanks, Jim
592	Info you wanted.
592	Jim
593	Thanks for the info.
593	Not sure what we're doing.
593	I'll pass this along.
593	Jim
594	Please consider this candidate for the position.
594	Jim
595	Probably want to talk with Jay Lewis and other product leads?
595	I'll get some names.
595	Jim
596	Did you attend?
596	Did we file comments?
596	Jim
597	Thanks for the info.
597	We need to push for other good load programs in PJM and New England.
597	Jim
598	Guys -- We need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to AEP's request for delay until 2003.
598	My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform).
598	AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.
598	My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).
598	Jean was going to call Luiz to get this issue on the burner.
598	Thanks
599	Paul -- What happens if BPA doesn't join?
599	Jim
600	Pls come by at 11am.
601	Agreed.
601	In fact, my understanding is that the ERCOT protocols state that if congestion is greater than $20 MM / year the model would change.
601	The market has reached $100 MM.
601	Jim
602	Dave -- Can you please send to Rick Shapiro the agenda for next Wednesday's meeting?
602	Thanks, Jim
603	HERE ARE THE FINAL SLIDES.
604	Wade -- Home 281-759-8270 Cell 713-851-2499
605	We should also make sure that Paul Kaufman and Pat Keene attend.
605	Thanks
606	Thanks for the info.
606	I'll leave in your and Leslie's capable hands.
606	Jim
607	Sarah -- Should we try and lobby any of these witnesses prior to next week?
607	I was thinking about John Meyer and Peter Cramton specifically.
607	Jim
608	I'd have Susan Lindberg and Charles take on this.
608	Jim
609	John -- On this bill, I would think that as far as our competitive businesses go, we should work through EPSA.
609	Better to have the industry speaking with one voice.
609	To that end, do we know where EPSA is on this - Reliant and Mirant will have a much larger impact.
609	Finally, we probably will need this ability for our Control Area operators.
609	Jim
610	I think that Kerry Stroup is handling non-MISO/ARTO midwest matters.
611	John -- I'm heading up tomorrow.
611	Do we need a call today to make sure that my ducks are still in a row?
611	I don't have the Barton draft handy.
611	Jim
612	Shirleen -- Can you please send me the most recent version?
612	Thanks.
613	Pls get with Susan to make sure coverage is appropriate.
613	Jim
614	Sounds good to me.
614	I'm out on Wednesday but in the rest of the week.
614	Jim
615	My comments -- I assume that in the Enron filing we will make a stronger argument for sticking with the 12-15-02 date?
615	Also, critical to highlight that the FERC should have one "major" change date, not multiple given the liquidity problems with significant regulatory change.
615	Finally, break out competitive retailers in the list of the ONE RTO Coalition.
615	Every state inside this region (except VT) has competitive retail access.
615	Furthering this effort with further the policy directions of the states by lowering wholesale prices and making business "easier" for companies like EES.
615	We should play this up.
615	We are really pushing hard on the physical retail gen side in NYC and Boston and taking another look at PA and MD - this is the real benefit - that consumers' bills go down.
615	I didn't see that language on consumer benefits.
615	Jim
616	Thanks for the info.
616	Please stay closely linked with the RTO Week activities to try and read Wood's questions.
616	Also, John Meyer from Reliant is testifying.
616	What will be his position?
616	Should we talk with him this week to coordinate and try and move him the right way?
616	Wasn't he the head of Congestion Management in ERCOT originally?
616	I think this is Wood trying to ask him how ERCOT works.
616	What will he say?
616	Thanks, Jim
617	Sarah -- Pls coordinate with Kerry Stroup.
617	He is the Mike Roan of the Upper Midwest.
617	Jim
618	FYI
619	Is this moving forward?
619	Jim
620	Sue and Jeff -- I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA (for customers already on DA).
620	Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter.
620	My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this (maybe?) and our #1 priority is to work to get the PG&E model adopted across the state.
620	Any news on how SCE and SDG&E will move forward?
620	Thanks.
621	Janine -- I have not yet talked to Kerry about this but the Translink is moving forward.
621	Will you do it today?
621	Jim
622	FYI
623	Please do.
623	Jim
624	Howard -- If the ONE RTO doesn't have a day-ahead market, what happens?
624	Jim
625	Thanks.
626	If you need anything else, please let me know.
626	Jim
627	Talk with John Shelk in our DC office.
627	Jim
628	Ban -- Sorry to take so long to reply.
628	Family is fine post NYC attacks.
628	Not sure if we have any needs right now.
628	I'll keep you in mind as the Budget / Staffing moves forward.
628	Take care, Jim
629	Looks fine.
629	Thanks for everything.
629	Jim
630	Thane -- Pls work with Christi and Sarah to find a time to call John.
630	Jim
631	Before I send this Louise, I'd like your thoughts.
631	The element that drives the EA # higher than I would have thought is the large number of people who are working on RTO and NERC only matters.
631	I've made a decision to assign these people to EA rather than spread to EES.
631	I could change if you think appropriate.
631	Thanks, Jim
632	Lisa - Please include G. Canovas in these discussions going forward.
632	Thanks.
633	Sure.
633	Jim
634	Dasovich this is in your court.
634	Jim
635	I looked at it today on the plane.
635	I don't see any issues although we are in the middle of budget process and will see if this impacts this request.
635	Jim
636	Need to also include the moneys owed to Enron and its affiliates related to the wholesale power transactions.
636	We should also seek to clarify the language about us supporting the PE Advice Letter proposal on going-forward.
636	Jim
637	The EWS West Power URM desk will need to determine the $$ at stake and help us manage our financial exposure and the appropriate policy response.
637	It's their $$.
637	So far, my understanding from the desk is that our current policy recommendations (as outlined in the Mike Smith memo) are the "preferred" outcome - I'll reconfirm.
637	Jim
638	Rick -- This is the spreadsheet.
638	Jim
639	Louise -- Here is the analysis on how many Govt Affairs' FTEs work on Enron Americas matters.
639	The bottom line = 67 Professionals in group / 29 FTEs on Enron Americas.
639	Call if you want additional information.
639	Also, I am trying to arrange a meeting for this Friday to discuss our next Monthly Update (which I am finishing hopefully tomorrow).
639	Thanks, Jim
640	perfect.
641	Pat -- I received your voice mail.
641	Will be testifying this morning.
641	I will try and call later today.
641	Thanks, Jim
642	Fine.
642	I still think that any obligation is a mistake.
642	Just improving a bad market is not going to help.
642	Make sure that Dan Allegretti is in the loop.
642	NEPOOL is putting something like this together.
642	Jim
643	On point #1 - I think that at the end of the day, FERC will not deal with the Negative CTC directly.
643	All they will do is reset prices.
643	The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.
643	We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the "high" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.
643	The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.
643	It simply took dysfunction and ran.
643	We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.
643	Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.
643	Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to "re-bill" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.
643	On point #2 - See point above.
643	I doubt, however, that all "high" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling.
643	Jim
644	FYI.
645	Fair points.
645	My dogma machine is running at high today.
645	Don't disagree with your thoughts.
645	Let's get the answer that works for the business for the long-term.
645	Jim
646	Diann -- I agree with Bob.
646	Please let us know as soon as possible if SCE is willing to discuss this fairly.
646	Jeanne -- I guess that we would update our Complaint if need be?
646	Thanks, Jim
647	I think it's a fair statement that Enron doesn't currently support the Barton language.
647	On this issue, I would argue that any penalty imposed should remain the purview of FERC and its procedures.
647	Jim
648	Mike -- Let's discuss.
648	I don't want to overextend our involvement to all regional reliability councils and all working groups.
648	If the MAPP RTC is critical, let's understand why and staff as best we can.
648	Jim
649	Jim -- Do have a final copy for my files?
649	I assume that we submitted?
649	Jim
650	I agree with John Shelk to not attack the CBO report.
650	While the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that generators "may" have withheld power, the basic argument is that "DEREGULATION ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED."
650	In addition, the paper states that "MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHES TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION."
650	In addition, California's response of "DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -- A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERSI hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat on the Refund case. The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the State's poor plan and actions created the financial and political crisis. The CBO finds that "WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET"..because "FEATURES OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET."
650	Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out (together with our details of the policy failures). This CBO report clearly undercuts the "political" arguments of the Davis administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible long-term contracts but has passed through 100% of the high costs to consumers. Jim
651	Today after the Hearing I attended lunch with John Anderson and Phil Harris.
651	One of the primary points of discussion involved what to do to respond to the NERC legislative efforts?
651	Basically we agreed that a straightforward delegation of authority over reliability to FERC made sense for all of the groups.
651	Agreeing to that, the idea is to review the Bingaman language and see if our groups could agree to that language.
651	I think that internally Enron is already there???
651	John Shelk, if you could pls send out the language to everyone on this e-mail to get agreement that would be very helpful.
651	I'll let you know how we next proceed.
651	If anyone has any problems, please let me know.
651	Thanks.
652	Lisa -- Who should I send this guy to?
652	Tim Battaglia?
652	Thanks.
653	Lisa -- I haven't forgotten about trying to find a name.
653	Was on vacation in early October.
653	I will ask around for the right name.
653	Hope Roger and you are doing well.
653	Grace is keeping Marianna and me very busy - she's now 19 months and pretty much runs the whole house.
653	Talk with you soon, Jim
654	Sarah & Christi -- Let's make sure that we get our comments together prior to the phone call.
654	How about a phone call at 8:30 am CDT on Friday?
654	Also, probably don't need everyone on the EPSA call so maybe we should organize our participation?
654	Pls let me know.
654	Jim
655	Steve -- We did originally file that the replacement for the PX Credit should be the DJ Index.
655	My recollection is that we did withdraw this argument, however I've include Sue Mara on this to double check.
655	If we haven't, I'd guess that is no longer URM's position?
655	Jim
656	FYI.
656	Probably too early for you guys.
656	Jim
657	Not that I know?
657	Jim
658	David -- My thoughts.
658	I would change the section "Reliability" to "Operations".
658	The Current framework is Non-standardized; Poor Seams Interface Under Access to Transmission I would change it to say that "Not all Users on the System take service in a non-discriminatory manner."
658	Utilities can't discriminate versus like users.
658	Under Generation - I would change "optional" to Optimal.
658	I don't also understand the 99%.
658	Easier to say 100%* * - Public Power recipricoity issues.
658	Thanks, Jim
659	thanks.
660	Ok.
660	Thanks.
660	I hope that Lora can send a copy.
660	Jim
661	Yes.
661	Peter is the one who I spoke with.
661	My testimony went fine.
661	Me too.
661	Jim
662	Steve -- Got a note from EES that there was a Energy Summit in MA to discuss next steps of restructuring today.
662	The meeting is today.
662	Are you going?
662	Did anyone go?
662	Thanks
663	thanks.
664	Thanks Janine.
664	Also, please keep Paul Kaufman and Jean Ryall in the loop.
664	We need to make sure that we do this nationally.
664	Thanks.
664	Jim
665	FYI
666	This is especially problematic given that EES and ENA can not comply with the reqts as defined.
666	Jim
667	Agree.
667	In fact this was John Anderson's only problem.
667	My position would be to simplify Bingaman's language to not define any organization.
667	Jim
668	Thanks.
669	Janine -- I want to make sure that our comments allow both a retail option and a wholesale option.
669	Let's also focus the PUCO on the fact that bidding leading to negotiations is the best solution, allows for creativity.
669	Jim
670	Please coordinate on this.
670	Jim
671	Here is my testimony.
671	I have one attachment that is being sent via fax.
671	Thanks, Jim
672	Attached is the testimony that I filed today asking thh PUC of Texas to open the retail markets in the SPP territory.
672	Thanks, Jim
673	The best outcome is that there is an obligation to dispose of load through this but the mechanism is negotiated.
673	Jim
674	I read the same.
674	It was crazy.
674	Their solution is to tell us to do what we said didn't make sense.
674	We won't give the FERC made up information.
674	Jim
675	Thanks for the draft.
675	Will circulate internally and respond.
675	Jim
676	Here is PJM's attempt at NERC language.
676	I think it makes sense for us to support this.
676	Jim
677	My understanding is that we are going to work Ark. Jim
678	Mary Lynne - Do you need anything on this?
678	Jim
679	How about Wednesday Oct 17 next week at 9am?
679	Jim
680	Thanks.
680	No major issues.
680	Jim
681	Thanks but my group has an all day budget meeting.
681	Maybe some other time.
681	Jim
682	Yes.
682	Her name is Linda Noske.
683	What does this mean??
683	Jim
684	Harry & Christi -- We need to be coordinating on this.
684	You both met with these people at different times.
684	I don't want to be creating work or stepping on each other.
684	I don't think there is any problem, but let's sit down and coordinate.
684	Thanks, Jim
685	Please let me know what we're doing on this?
685	You are the Project Lead.
685	Go get 'em.
685	Jim
686	Sarah -- You're call on working with EPSA.
686	Get everything you can.
686	I don't understand how "new services" is moving fast enough.
686	Jim
687	Sorry.
687	I'll be in Austin testifying.
687	Jim
688	good luck
689	Guillermo - Before you send any letters, please make sure that Steve Montovano is the in loop.
689	He manages that region.
689	Jim
690	Change the language on Operations to include ...Coordination of Service and Planning for Transmission ...
690	Thanks, Jim
691	No. Although the lack of a concrete decision is a "decision" - just not one we like.
691	Our goal is to get this dealt with by end of November.
691	Jim
692	Christi -- Some interesting language for the ICAP team.
692	Please forward along.
692	Jim
693	Jeff -- In a budget meeting, will call this afternoon unless something critical.
693	Thanks, Jim
694	Sorry that I didn't get to you sooner.
694	The head of the group is Tim Battaglia who is the best person to work with.
694	Jim
695	Not really.
695	I tried to get to talk to her but never could get an opportunity.
695	Jim
696	Didn't get invited.
696	Are you going?
696	I don't plan on sending anything - do you think we should even though we didn't get any invitations?
696	Jim
697	I'll play the cheap course.
697	Jim
698	Ray -- Looks very good.
698	We need to stress the points on what we need FERC to do -- fix their mistakes in the Rehearing.
698	One other point, maybe we should stress that FERC could open these proceedings and not delay the decision because the Cal ISO is taking so long.
698	Also, don't be shy about describing how the process is going so slowly and the "abuses" of the Cal ISO and its lack of independence.
698	Jim
699	Jose & Charles -- Thanks for the update.
699	I am concerned that "customers" are talking about having NERC deal with commercial matters without first agreeing to FERC's control over everything?
699	We should discuss the Goulding Report when you return.
699	Jim
700	Let me know about how you intend to move forward.
700	Probably the same team as the CA reporting.
700	Also, what did AGA do with its Storage Figure Report?
700	I heard that they cancelled the publication.
700	Jim
701	Sure.
702	Thanks.
702	We will discuss in context of State review.
702	Jim
703	FYI.
703	Call Jeff if you have more questions.
703	Jim
704	Does this make sense?
704	Jim
705	I'll go to the Houston meeting.
705	Jim
706	Should this go into Janine's efforts on Markets?
706	Jim
707	Thanks.
707	I want to talk about this on the "Consultants" call with Linda Robertson.
707	Should we push this argument or leave the FERC with its infirmities?
707	I believe that we can work away at many of our concerns in the "should refunds be reqd" phase.
707	Jim
708	Jeff -- Look at the letter.
708	I see no issues.
708	Call me with your thoughts.
708	Jim
709	Thanks for the information.
709	At this time, I don't think that I am interested in any reports.
709	Jim
710	Please put in swepco file for thurs.
711	Pls put in SWEPCO file.
711	Jim
712	Linda -- Pls include in the file.
712	Jim
713	Pls put in my SWEPCO folder.
714	FYI
715	I think that this is a good step but we need to remember that NERC in the commercial sector may not prove to be the end all.
715	Also, while RTOs may enforce the standards or set the standards, not sure if we want one organization doing both.
715	Jim
716	Any time you want to you should feel free.
716	Jim
717	Did we decide not to join with anyone else?
717	Jim
718	HERE IS THE REPORT.
718	Jim
719	Great idea.
719	My key points would be that (a) FERC needs to push ahead with its "right sized" RTOs and (b) focus on standardizing the tariff and market design [no more collaborative efforts].
719	Two simple, easy to understand thoughts.
719	Also, I think that it's a mistake to use the term "large RTOs".
719	We don't want large RTOs.
719	We want RTOs that cover natural markets and benefit consumers.
719	Jim
720	Looks good.
720	Is there a timeline on when FERC may act (or at least when the Audit) will be final?
720	Is this information confidential?
720	Should we be working the trade press?
720	Thanks, Jim
721	If FERC agrees, does this hurt our retail business and the implementation of our retail gen product next year?
721	Jim
722	Steve -- What's up with GA PSA Wise wanting to open marketers books?
722	Saw this in Gas Daily today.
722	Any info is helpful.
722	Jim
723	There are some Commodity meetings.
723	One with Jim Wood and one with Greg Sharp.
723	Harry, can you please call and get on these meeting schedules?
723	Also, Guillermo Canovas and Melinda Pharms are going to the EES gas meeting weekly.
723	Jim
724	Damon -- Good idea.
724	I'm out early next week.
724	How about next Thursday?
724	Jim
725	Seems reasonable to me that we tell NERC they can't "make a land grab".
725	How about EPSA and ELCON signing a letter together to the Chairman of NERC Board?
725	Jim
726	Christi -- DQE provides some level of audit capability to ensure that the costs are fair and apppropriate.
726	PGE may not have a resource specific system lambda but AW may be able to explain how they would implement something like this.
726	I know AW from some other issues so if things don't go well let me know.
726	Also, please keep Alan Comnes in the loop.
726	Thanks, Jim
727	Thanks.
728	With the discussions at NERC recently to broaden their role, I think that we need to be very coordinated on our EISB message and begin to figure out how we get AGA to work with the Retail Gas and EEI/UBR to work with the Retail Power quadrants.
728	Let's think about a NARUC message to drive this very quickly (maybe at the next meeting).
728	Having one body begin to coordinate all of these matters will greatly expand our policy reach.
728	Thanks, Jim
729	Are these papers consistent with Enron's positions?
729	Jim
730	No. Jim Steffes
731	What do you think??
731	Jim
732	Jean -- The PUCT voted to delay for SPP markets.
732	Not sure about Entergy.
732	Any news?
732	Can you send out something to the business people?
732	Jim
733	Your thoughts?
733	Jim
734	It is critical to win this case.
734	Sounds to me that Dynegy wants ICAP in the Midwest.
734	Jim
735	Sounds reasonable.
735	Would the same be true about the DST case?
735	If we lose, without the PPO what do we have?
735	Jim
736	Pls call Steve.
736	Jim
737	Alan -- What about a simple price cap (ala PJM) of $250/Mwh rather than a gas-index deriviative?
737	Just a thought, do whatever the desk thinks is right.
737	Jim
738	sounds good.
738	pls talk with Bob Frank about his involvement in this group.
738	Jim
739	The first order of business is getting the cost/benefit analysis done.
739	Once we have that study, let's go to press.
739	Jim
740	thanks.
741	Can we have breakfast Wednesday morning at the Park Hyatt to discuss where we are and necessary next steps?
741	Given Southern's statements (as well as others), this is the key analysis that would hold up this from moving forward.
741	Jim
742	Pat -- Are we doing dinner with Keith Tuesday?
742	Jim
743	My Top 5 1.( ) *Up to the minute restructuring data.
743	2.( ) Catalog of Enron public documents [policy talking points, handouts] 3.( ) Thumbnail analyses by industry experts on various topics 4.( ) *Enron formal documents [filings, comments, testimony] 5.
743	Other - CUSTOMER NEWSLETTER / MONTHLY POLICY POSITION "push"
744	ok.
744	I'm booked all week but next week I can do it.
744	Jim
745	Yes.
745	And I'll need clubs (right handed).
745	Thanks for doing this, Jim
746	Any idea when this will be rescheduled?
746	Jim
747	Tom -- Where do we stand with this?
747	Jim
748	A few notes.
748	1.
748	Be cautious about divestiture.
748	Remember we own pipes and a electric LDC.
748	2.
748	Agree with you that we don't want Utility in merchant role - key issue.
748	3.
748	POLR issue involves getting pricing right.
748	Why don't you put together a note to the CAEM that we can send as our thoughts.
748	Just the Top 5 issues.
748	Jim
749	Try to respond end of the week.
749	I'd like to see your drafts.
749	Jim
750	This evening and stay until Wed pm.
750	Jim
751	I didn't get the attachment.
751	If you want my thoughts, please let me know.
751	Jim
752	Thanks for the update.
752	It is disappointing that AGA is not opening the process, although the final EISB Retail Gas standards will need to be vetted by an ANSI group so we'll get our comments in one way or the other.
752	Also, what are we doing to get the different states to adopt these protocols across the board?
752	Seems like pushing NARUC to agree that this is the right vehicle makes sense.
752	Thanks, Jim
753	Thanks Luiz.
753	As a follow-up, I'd like to be on record as saying that the PUCT wasted my time in flying to Austin (when plane travel is not secure, I'd add) and not even listening to my statements.
753	Why bring us if they had already made the decision?
753	Also, I don't know who is going to pay for more Market Readiness work in SPP unless AEP agrees to pay our costs.
753	The customers pay for their activities.
753	Jim
754	Sounds good.
754	Please make sure that Jeff Brown in EES is kept in the loop if this gets close to goal line.
754	Jim
755	No, but I'm happy to ride with almost anyone.
755	Jim
756	Wanda -- Who do I need to call at EPMI West Power to discuss the following - We are considering proposing a Settlement for SCE.
756	The language we are considering on the Negative CTC is as follows.
756	Does this help or hurt?
756	Do we have "final ISO invoices"?
756	Please call me.
756	Jim
757	Lisa -- Let me know what you decide.
757	Jim
758	Barbara -- What's up with TN?
758	Did we ever solve the issue with Stokes Bartholomew funding with the commercial team?
758	Jim
759	Thanks.
759	Jim
760	Mike -- I'd shorten the letter to one page by simply referencing the State Commission's letter and issues.
760	Don't we want to also work on pushing a Mediation (or some other solution) right now?
760	Donna -- Pls check with Linda R. about filing.
760	It's important but let's make sure our overall FERC strategy is consistent.
760	Jim
761	Ok.
761	I may call Keith anyway.
761	Jim
762	Randy -- Last minute, I'm coming to DC today through Wednesday afternoon.
762	Any chance to grab dinner or a beer?
762	You're probably swamped, but thought I'd check.
762	I'm staying at Park Hyatt (24 and M) - leave a number if it works 202-419-6795.
762	Thanks, Jim
763	Leaving for airport - can we talk in am???
763	Jim
764	Thanks.
764	If you need any additional support pls let me know.
764	Also, pls send my best to Thane and his family.
764	Jim
765	Vicki -- I will be in town on Thursday and available to meet.
765	Assuming that the meeting won't go for more than 1 - 1.5 hours, I'd be happy to attend.
765	Thanks, Jim
766	Yes.
766	I've called Keith and he says he can also go.
766	Please call Lora Sullivan 202-466-9142 to arrange a time.
766	I'm good whenever.
766	Jim
767	I think that EES would like to send out some regulatory information on a regular basis.
767	Maybe qty instead of monthly.
767	Nothing formal right now.
767	Jim
768	Randy -- Dinner is at 7:45 pm at Cashion's Eat Place - 1819 Columbia.
768	Keith is coming.
768	Call me on my cell phone at 713-851-2499 with any problems.
768	Hope to see you there.
768	Jim
769	FYI.
770	Charles & Jose -- The spinmisters are already at work.
770	People at FERC thought we had bought into the "new NERC" Enron DOES NOT SUPPORT NERC in working through commercial issues.
770	We need to develop our opinions of where to go next, but right now you can respond to Dave Nevius that we still don't believe that NERC and its process/organziation is the right vehicle.
770	We are willing to find a way to do this, but we can't have the same SRO bullshit that they have been saying for 3 years.
770	Sorry I missed the call.
770	I'll talk with you guys Friday.
770	Jim
771	No. Talk with Pat Keene and/or Leslie Lawner.
771	We haven't done much on Arizona lately.
771	Jim
772	Jeff -- I'd leave the number blank for all parties to be discussed between the different parties.
772	Best way would be to have some Attachments for the amount that the companies can sign after everything else.
772	Don't want Dan Douglas to know the $$$ before Richard Sanders oks.
772	Jim
773	Roy -- Do we need to run a more thorough legal analysis to check?
773	I trust your thoughts.
773	I just don't want to be left hanging.
773	I'd rather spend $2500 now than have this come back and bite us in the $%*@.
773	Jim
774	I think when you add the publics into Southern they'll hit 40k.
774	It may make sense to send this question to Intellibridge.
774	We have their resource.
774	Call Margaret Allen in Houston she'll have their number.
774	Jim
775	thanks.
776	FYI.
776	Jim
777	Pat -- If you're in on Friday, let's sit down for 15.
777	Thanks, Jim
778	Fine by me.
778	Not sure if I'd make so much of the recent FERC statements - may come true if we don't keep a straightforward message.
779	Agree.
780	Jeff -- How would we calculate EES' "contribution" to SCE undercollection?
780	Jim
781	How about 1pm Friday afternoon?
781	You on a plane.
781	Jim
782	We (Marianna and I) decided that with the new baby on the way - not sure if you knew this - that now wasn't the time to head to DC.
782	Although with the stock price and company in shambles, maybe it would be a more "conservative" bet.
782	Hope you're doing well.
782	Jim
783	No big deal.
783	Next time I'm in town I'll give you a little more notice.
783	Hope things are going well at State - for what it's worth, I think it would be a total mistake for America to stop our hunt for Osama during the Muslim religious month...I don't think the grieving families in NYC and around the Pentagon are going to stop their mourning for their loved ones during that timeframe.
783	Just one opinion out of millions.
783	Take care, Jim
784	I would like to schedule a phone call with Nick and the PUCT staff to understand the implication of this...
784	Maybe he isn't asking for too much, but let's get some clarity before we say anything at FERC.
784	Can you please set something up with you, Christi, Jean and me for Friday pm and then we'll go outside next week??
784	Jim
785	Linda -- Pls set up a 30 minute meeting with Melinda tomorrow.
785	Thanks
786	I know that SCE is taking this position.
786	They are simple wrong.
786	Unless and until we get all of our "positive" CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their "goofy" arguments.
786	In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.
786	If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that's a different policy matter.
786	The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.
786	Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.
786	They aren't talking about 5% from our view $150 MM claim.
786	Jim
787	Thanks.
787	We're happy but Marianna is extremely sick - all day.
787	Enron could see $10 easily.
787	It's very bad!!!!!
787	Jim
788	Good work.
789	FYI
790	Great job.
790	What are the back out rates for CH going forward?
790	Any improvement in the market?
790	Jim
791	I'm back in Thursday am.
791	Let's beat the heck out of Dynegy on this case.
791	Jim
792	We have not made public the SCE amount (as far as I'm aware).
792	We need to make sure that IR is in the loop - I think that Mark Koenig is following this issue.
792	Jim
793	Great job Leslie.
793	Let's keep up the pressure.
793	Jim
794	May be some value here when all over.
795	We should the testimony at FERC in the ARTO docket.
795	By pushing FERC to get with the program and by pushing ARTO to use a better CM model, we'll get leverage.
795	Taking it to the PUCO is a nice step, but I don't think that they are going to change the current ARTO program.
795	By the way, where is the PUCO on ARTO / MISO issues?
795	Thanks, Jim
796	Isn't there a better option for all of the ComEd issues - open the legislation???
796	Why not talk with ComEd about this???
796	Jim
797	Are we winning?
797	Any movement on our issues?
797	Jim
798	I would think that we should take the time to talk with local counsel or other "allies" to get a feel for the chances in AZ.
798	I also think that the difficulty in AZ will be a physical problem with getting transmission service - no RTO.
798	It would be great to have a thorough analysis of problems in every open market just to know what the issues are.
798	Jim
799	I'll be at my desk.
800	Yes.
800	Although probably more useful (if we have a smoking gun) in the Legislative arena.
800	DOE has no authority over TVA.
800	Jim
801	Joe -- Let us know.
801	Jim
802	David - You should contact Mike Smith in EES legal.
802	He is the one to respond to this allegation.
802	My fax is 713-646-8160.
802	Jim
803	Agreed.
803	Need to talk this morning about our exposures.
803	Jim
804	Bill -- Steve Kean needs to talk with some analysts today about our CA exposures.
804	Can you send me your most recent information on our wholesale and Negative CTC exposures as soon as possible?
804	Call me with questions.
804	Jim
805	Wade -- Attached are some additions.
805	Looks fine.
805	Mary Lynne Ruffer has the most recent Negative CTC numbers (my understanding is $405MM for PG&E and $100MM for SCE as of today).
805	Jim
806	Linda -- Please put on my calendar that I will not travel or go out of town for all of May 2002.
806	I will be in Houston during this period.
806	Thanks
807	Craig -- As we discussed yesterday, we would be very interested in a memo outlining a work product that would document the cost/benefit of RTOs.
807	If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me at 713-853-7673.
807	Thanks.
807	Jim
808	Sue - Received your voice mail.
808	Having AReM only file is ok with me.
808	Spoke with Lamar Frazier - Jeremy sounds worried.
808	Let's make sure that the contract question is vetted with internal and external lawyers - agree not to give CPUC any info.
808	Thanks, Jim
809	FYI.
809	You may want to send out to RTO team.
809	Jim
810	Thanks.
811	Jeremy -- To let you know where we stand on the CPUC's Investigation on DA Suspension.
811	1.
811	Sue Mara is leading the effort to respond to the CPUC for Enron.
811	2.
811	We knew that the CPUC was at a minimum going to investigate how and/or whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge $$ to DA load given their earlier statements.
811	The issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and (I believe) as leverage for other issues.
811	3.
811	We are coordinating with the big customers who recently left.
811	They are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity.
811	This is as much their fight as it is ours.
811	4.
811	At this time, Enron will file as a member of AReM.
811	We intend to oppose the CPUC's request for our contracts and transaction information.
811	If you want any other info or want to discuss further, let me know.
811	Jim
812	Vince -- I see that you are on the panel on market monitoring.
812	Dave Perrino and Alan Comnes are following the issue for Enron in the Western power markets as RTOs are formed.
812	It may make sense for some people from Govt Affairs to talk with you to discuss current issues and focus of FERC and others?
812	If we can get together, please let me know a good time.
812	Also, the attached paper from EPSA on Market Monitoring is something we support through our trade association.
812	Thanks, Jim
813	Steve -- What's up??
813	Jim
814	Here are my thoughts.
814	Use as you see fit.
814	Jim
815	Let me know.
815	I'd talk with APS just to find out more details.
815	If we do, let's take Dave Perrino our wholesale guy to also talk about RTOs.
815	Jim
816	Some more information would be nice.
816	These seem low.
816	Jim
817	Agreed.
817	Jim
818	I think that California needs to make a final decision on whether it wants competitive markets or not.
818	I wonder if PURPA has anything to say about meeting incremental Utility needs and what that does to the CDWR contracts?
818	I don't see Enron getting engaged in this quagmire unless there is a clear business reason.
818	Jim
819	If made to choose, I'm for Option a) below.
819	Jim
820	Thanks.
821	Thanks for moving ahead.
821	Jim
822	Agreed.
822	Pls make sure the PUCT understands this.
822	Jim
823	Will do.
824	What record will FERC file today???
824	This is crazy.
824	Ray please call me when you get in. Jim
825	Who at Reliant said this???
825	I'd let them go forward and we'll do our own.
825	Jim
826	Guillermo -- I should sign the letter.
826	Also, we should be consistent on affiliates given EPMI and Enron Gas Mktg.
826	We are affiliates of a pipeline.
826	We offer competitive services on the affiliated pipelines.
826	Let's be consistent with our own business.
826	When are you going to send the letter?
826	Jim
827	Sarah -- Do we need to replace Tom on the Reg Project list??
827	Jim
828	What did we do on this??
828	Jim
829	Rogers -- Harry Kingerski informed me that you and some team members were going to visit ConEd to discuss the Benchmark Rate Swap.
829	I think it's a great idea (Scott Gahn and I had discussed something similar a few years ago when he ran URM).
829	My only thoughts for you would be: 1) maybe difficult to do the swap with the Utility (given PUC oversight), but the Holding company should be in the same place financially and should be protected from PUC scrutiny and 2) being long T&D (assuming that you don't sell 100% of the position to customers) creates interesting regulatory questions.
829	I'd love to sit down with you to discuss this product.
829	Jim
830	Any luck on my password??
830	Jim
831	Mike -- When you have the list of customers we should contact, please let me know.
831	I should try and get back with Ashley today.
831	Jim
832	Chip -- Did you get the chance to look at the combined company?
832	Just interested.
832	Thanks
833	Dale -- Right now I'm in all of next week (although may have to travel on Thursday).
833	Jim
834	Linda -- Pls arrange a room for a visit from Ken Malloy on Nov 6 at 8:30 am.
834	Thanks, Jim
835	Bob -- Where do we stand on the SCE stipulation?
835	I want to make sure that our push in SCE doesn't conflict or contradict something we are doing in the PG&E discussions.
835	Can we meet today?
835	Jim
836	Susan -- Please talk with Jeff Golden and the EES Dist Generation group to get their take as well.
836	Thanks, Jim
837	Scott -- Any thoughts on this merger???
837	I would love to know how the financials would look post merger.
838	Charles -- My final edits.
838	Let's talk.
838	Also, please let John Shelk and Sarah look at before sending to EPSA.
838	Jim
839	I will let Ashley Brown know.
839	Do you have phone numbers for these guys?
839	Also, NG is willing to do a conference call late Wednesday or meeting on Thursday.
839	What do you think?
839	Jim
840	How about 2:30 CST?
840	Jim
841	Sounds good.
841	Should we put out a note through Ginger that indicates the changes???
841	Jim
842	How about 2pm EST - 1pm CST?
842	Jim
843	FYI.
843	EPSA looks interested in undertaking a cost-benefit analysis.
843	As soon as I hear more, I'll give everyone the info.
843	Jim
844	Thanks.
844	I want you on the call.
844	Try to do Wednesday pm conference call.
844	Jim
845	Thanks.
845	We have some relationship with Trans-elect - supported Trans-elect on the NG question of managing member of ARTO.
845	If you want to sit down with them, let me know.
845	Jim
846	3 is better.
846	Jim
847	Ashley - We would prefer (given the schedules) to hold a conference call on Wednesday pm with a group of marketers/generators.
847	Seems like the easiest way to discuss with everyone.
847	It would be great to have a paper from NG earlier in the week.
847	Here is our list of recommended people.
847	Probably best to have NG or you call to invite (rather than Enron) to highlight your interest in brokering a deal in the Midwest.
847	Constellation (Harvey Reed) 410 468 3480 Edison Mission Energy (Reem Fahey) 312 583 6033 Thanks, Jim
848	Tom -- You may at some time want to cross train on NYISO rules - especially as the region integrates.
848	Thanks, Jim
849	Dave -- Pat Keene is working on a number of issues before the NV Commission on retail access and unbundling (one thing being the implementation of DA for C&I).
849	Can you please reach out to him to help on some transmission issues involved in retail competition.
849	Thanks, Jim
850	What lobbying did Enron do last year with regard to EnronOnline and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act?
851	thanks.
852	FYI.
852	Steve you may want to be on this call.
852	Jim
853	Seems to me that we need to engage in AZ (along with NV and OR?) in the Western states to try and push competition forward.
853	Why don't we first assemble a (1) what we know - what we don't know memo and then (2) look at oppotunities to push our agenda.
853	Leslie - everyone is looking to you to lead us to the promised land in AZ...
853	GO GET 'EM!!!!!!
853	Jim
854	Mike -- How about lunch at 11:30 - meet in the lobby?
854	Jim
855	Ricardo -- I tried to call this morning - no answer.
855	Pls give me a call today.
855	Jim
856	Sorry -- I need to be in Houston both days.
856	Jim
857	FYI
858	Fine.
858	Everything's crazy at Enron.
858	Just trying to keep my head down.
858	Thanks, Jim
859	Do all REPs have to report this information - including our customer complaints?
859	Even if we only serve non-PTB customers?
859	Who is tracking this internally assuming we have to file it?
859	Do the business people understand this obligation?
859	Jim
860	Ok.
860	It seems that (1) we should try and get a handle on AZ - Leslie Lawner please put something together and (2) need a Market Plan on NV - Pat Keene put together.
860	Paul, I appreciate the issue with OR but I'd like to know what is the opportunity and make sure that PGE is not destroying our chances - Christi got wind of a Imbalance pgm that was punative to marketers.
860	Who can we meet with to discuss?
860	Jim
861	Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.
861	1.
861	Form Enron Negotiation Team My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.
861	My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.
861	Jeff should only be there to make introductions.
861	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.
861	3.
861	Reformed Stipulation I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.
861	Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.
861	4.
861	Meeting My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.
861	Can everyone make it that needs to be there?
861	Probably meet in California.
861	We should put the laundry list on the table.
861	Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.
861	Thanks, Jim
862	To discuss this outline and our issues list, can people attend a 2pm Houston Time call.
862	The meet and confer may be on-going, but maybe either Jeff or Sue can jump off.
862	Linda Noske will be sending out a call-in number.
862	Thanks, Jim
863	FYI.
864	Nancy -- I don't understand.
864	Will this delay the opening of the ERCOT Tx market???
864	We must do everything possible to open the market on time - Jan 1 2002.
864	Jim
865	We also need to check reporting for post Jan 1.
865	Gloria can you make sure that Rebecca Fite knows this.
865	Jim
866	I was hoping to meet with PGE (but will hold off it is imprudent).
866	Christi has reviewed something.
866	I'll loop her in to find out all the details.
866	Jim
867	Christi -- What's the latest on the PGE imbalance method??
867	Jim
868	My fault for not making it clear that you should have been in the loop.
868	We will send out a message across the board to help with this.
868	Jim
869	This is critical that we are all pushing this...
869	Please let me know if any obstacles develop.
869	Jim
870	Are we still friends??
871	Nancy -- Go get 'em!!!
871	You'll do great.
871	Just be factual and explain how you've worked on these issues in multiple states.
871	Jim
872	Good job.
872	Jim
873	My thoughts -- 1.
873	Focus more on Tariff standardization (I think that this is the key issue for Enron because LMP based bid balancing market is almost a done deal - and the Texas market seems to be fine for liquidity).
873	Build around a new proforma with a NETWORK PLUS model.
873	2.
873	I would highlight that size matters - re-double our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments.
873	3.
873	I would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no source/sink requirement.
873	4.
873	The gas / power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration (ie, CNG) but because of the geographic reach.
873	Many LDCs used Columbia p/l, but only one LDC uses AEPs.
873	The electric market needs transmission to be "rationalized" across the marketplace so moving power to where it's needed from where it's at.
873	5.
873	Should we attack the 209 Boards?
873	Agree that they are unnecessary, but pls be careful.
873	Thanks, Jim
874	Janine -- Good job.
874	On the hourly market price index, until we have LMP dispatch, the best we can do is a public index.
874	Let's not ask for too much.
874	Just something we can hedge against.
874	Can you talk with the EWS folks for the best index option???
874	Also, if the default is a monthly public index, why do the customer's need any "parking"?
874	They can move directly to the new option.
874	What is your definition of "functioning wholesale market"?
874	Are we stating that unless an RTO is running, we can't get rid of the PPO?
874	Maybe just resolve the Imbalance issue.
874	More specifics would be helpful.
874	Thanks, Jim
875	no.
876	Trying to put something together.
876	Jim
877	Think the best thing is to let it ride - no sense in discussing because we don't have a solution for them.
877	See if any intelligence on how hard they are going to push NPCo to fight us.
877	Jim
878	Yes.
878	Thanks.
879	Ok.
879	Also, don't forget about the Dynegy v. ComEd dispute at FERC.
879	Important for us in our physical business.
879	Probably want the letter to be a little more specific on a monthly index v. an hourly.
879	Also, what about the 400 kw size distinction, is this the right #?
879	May want to talk with Jim Wood.
879	Isn't the DST question also important?
879	The ICC's decision will impact the need for a PPO.
879	Jim
880	Charles -- The RTO week stuff is different from SSO stuff, right?
880	Jim
881	Gloria -- Vicki Sharp was interested in trying to update our Licenses throughout the country.
881	I will arrange a meeting for us to follow-up.
881	Thanks, Jim
882	agree
883	Lisa -- I'll leave it to you to decide if Mike Day needs or should be at the SCE initial meeting.
883	I received a message that he can, but haven't told him either way.
883	Pls advise.
883	Jim
884	FYI.
885	Linda -- Pls put on my calendar.
885	Pls arrange a room and have Mike Roan and Luiz Maurer attend (also invite Kerry Stroup).
885	Thanks, Jim
886	Sarah & Christi -- Can you ask the Project Leaders on the key projects for a timeline (comments due date, etc.) of their activities?
886	I would love to have a crib sheet to know when to expect comments.
886	I saw the NOPR commetns on Code of Conduct was moved to Dec 20.
886	Thanks, Jim
887	Harry -- Do want to shepherd the development of our comments?
887	Team would be you (lead), Charles, Nancy Hetrick, Andy Rodriquez, Christi Nicolay.
887	What do you think?
887	Jim
888	Can someone please cover this meeting?
888	Jim
889	Pls put on my calendar.
889	Jim
890	cheers.
891	Friday breakfast works for me.
891	6:30 am at 59 Diner.
891	Jim
892	No. I'll let her know if she asks.
892	Thanks,
893	FYI
894	I would probably utilize either EPSA or WPTF to make the filing.
894	This is an attack on the competitive generation industry and better to not have Enron point any fingers at a key "potential" customer.
894	Jim
895	FYI
896	When: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 12:00 PM-1:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
896	Can you make this phone call?
896	Susan is on vacation.
897	When: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 2:00 PM-3:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
897	I'll be on the call.
897	You guys are of course welcome.
897	My thought is that we need to push EPSA to do something on this.
897	Jim
898	I will be attending.
898	I'll cover.
898	Jim
899	Jim
900	They are active throughout the West - mainly California.
900	We can use them.
900	Both are good.
900	Jim
901	Kevin -- Last update that I know about for CDWR costs.
901	If Sue or Jeff know of later $ figures, please advise Kevin.
901	Also, my understanding was that the CPUC simply disallowed the CDWR from having straight passthru without review.
901	They may get to charge 100% of these dollars, but needs CPUC approval.
901	Jim
902	If Reliant is interested in filing, we should seriously consider using EPSA.
902	Reliant is a member of EPSA.
902	We could get EPSA to work through Larry Robertson maybe.
902	Let's discuss next week in Houston.
902	Jim
903	thanks for sending this out.
903	Jim
904	I haven't processed a bill.
905	FYI.
906	Thanks for getting the info to Keeney.
906	Jim
907	I don't know if we need to do anything.
907	Seems like they are just acquiring the MAIN facilities, not market design material.
907	Have you spoken to anyone at ARTO to inquire?
907	Jim
908	Mike -- You should contact Lisa M. about the SCE meeting arrangements.
908	I will be there in spirit only.
908	Jim
909	FYI.
910	Linda -- Have you heard anything from DOE on this??
910	Jim
911	It will be difficult to understand the impact of our credit decline on a per transaction basis.
911	It is probably sufficient to communicate with the Credit department (under Bill Bradford) for wholesale and the EWS Services Group (under Evan Hughes) for retail.
911	I spoke with Evan Hughes and he is going to have CSC run a report of the tariff obligations.
911	He will send the info to me and I'll forward to Amr Ibrahim.
911	Thanks.
912	Thanks.
913	Marcus N. says that everything is done on our emergency project this morning.
913	Sam Behrens will write an opinion letter to allow the move without the need for a 203 filing and everything else is in place.
913	Steve Montovano has/is confirming that in PA, OH, and NJ there are no outstanding tax or regulatory matters.
913	We probably want to put in place an update to Clinton's MBR that would allow for A/S trading.
913	Should we just have Sam do that work??
913	Jim
914	Tom -- I received a call today from the CPUC (came through the main Enron number) - a CPUC staffer named Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).
914	Someone named Dan at the Quail Ridge Research Station (7001 Hwy 128 Napa, CA 94558) called the CPUC to complain that he was inappropriately switched from PG&E to Enron.
914	It's a strange situation - the Universities own the bldg and land but a Trust pays the bills.
914	He says that "the facility isn't anywhere near the campus."
914	The PG&E account number is ZNL8242005.
914	His phone number is 503-752-0873.
914	I told him that we would look into this and get back by end of business Thursday.
914	The CPUC staffer is Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).
914	My guess is that UC/CSU listed this account on a switch request but didn't ask Dan.
914	What should we do??
914	Jim
915	Fine.
915	People are shocked.
915	Jim
916	Linda -- Can you also please process Jose's documents?
916	Jim
917	FYI.
917	Do we need to communicate this to the trading / logistics groups?
917	Jim
918	I would probably not sign on directly, but would support the document with the additional thoughts -- 1.
918	I don't understand a 6 month collaborative to work through SMD - this only extends the implementation.
918	2.
918	Need to push harder on doing away with the Reserve obligation.
918	3.
918	I would argue that the RTO need not run a Day Ahead market.
918	Also, why does a Day Ahead market provide "sufficient capacity committed in the right places for the next day in order to supply load reliably"?
918	California has a DA market and people simply did not participate.
918	The argument that a DA market replaces a Unit Committment process doesn't seem complete?
918	4.
918	The position and implications on CM and RT market going in at the same time needs to be made more clear - does this mean that Enron supports delaying all RTO "activity" (e.g., OASIS, single tariff, rates) until CM is complete?
918	5.
918	What is a "point-to-point" financial hedge?
918	Does this imply node-to-node?
918	Can we include some discussion of market "hubs"?
918	How could I obtain a hub-to-node hedge?
918	Also, what about the allocation or auction process for FTRs?
918	How should existing transmission arrangements be managed?
918	6.
918	Do we agree to Incremental pricing vs. Rolled-In?
918	Will this cause any heartburn for ETS?
918	What about the cost of expansion to meet the needs of incremental generation?
918	Should this be borne by the system or the generator?
918	My thought is that this is a big piece and Enron should probably file its own comments rather than sign on.
918	Sarah Novosel is working on Enron comments.
918	Jim
919	Gloria -- I wanted to make sure that our License in TX allows us to use e-signatures?
919	EES is opening a pilot.
919	Jim
920	Alan -- I assume that you will lead Enron's response to EPSA's comments?
920	Should we have a discussion of this filing before the EPSA meeting on Friday?
920	Pls give me a call.
920	Jim
921	Interesting.
921	Seems to me that EPSA needs to help AZ do better by its citizens - it's not just APS that's a "bunch of neanderthals" (to use a Rick Shapiro phrase).
921	I don't understand something else - Is Mumaw APS' and EES' counsel in AZ??
921	How is this possible?
921	Jim
922	Marcus -- I would recommend that Enron not do anything to modify the Clinton MBR tariff at FERC right now.
922	It may make sense for Sam Behrens to work up a "clean up" filing to be ready to go upon any action.
922	Pls give me a call if you want to discuss or would like us to take a different approach.
922	Jim
923	Here are some thoughts from me.
923	Jim
924	Lara -- I would think that Alan Comnes would be good (if he can make it) to go.
924	Jim
925	Understand.
925	When you speak of the gas desk, are you talking to Scott Neal and Frank Vickers or Don Black??
925	We should make sure that both groups recognize our message.
925	Jim
926	Sue -- I agree with your arguments.
926	The other problem with SCE's analysis is that they had a DEFINED stranded cost amount and they deserve that money.
926	What California did (my explaination) is that SCE was offered frozen rates for 4 years.
926	All of the margin they "earned" was shareholder's compensation for moving to direct access.
926	If the total $$ of margin was $0 or less, this implies simply that SCE had no generation stranded costs.
926	The entire argument that SCE is making forgets the $Billion that they have kept from consumers through the fixed rate.
927	FYI.
927	Who are they hiring as lobbyists?
927	Jim
928	Thanks.
929	Leslie -- It's my understanding that Janine is just reviewing the Eastern US.
929	If I'm wrong, Janine please correct me.
929	Thanks
930	Let's sit down at 5pm to discuss.
930	Jim
931	Can you please resend the fax to Barbara Hueter about the TN legal bill?
931	Thanks,
932	Maggie -- You may want to attend - Global Markets?
932	Jim
933	Amr -- Not for us to contact the ISOs about our Material change.
933	Jim
934	Great job!!!!
935	FYI.
936	Thanks.
936	Appreciate the quick response.
936	Jim
937	How about 10am Tuesday??
938	FYI.
939	let's discuss at 5pm
940	I don't think that Govt Affairs should do anything on this (and not sure if there is anything to do).
941	I'd say 6 pm at Daily Review or Marks.
941	What does everyone think?
941	Jim
942	thanks.
943	Guillermo -- Looks good to me.
943	I'll discuss with Amr to ensure his agreement.
943	Jim
944	Thanks.
944	Having this e-mail on the agenda for the upcoming meeting is very helpful.
944	Jim
945	Sue -- My thoughts on the filing.
945	1.
945	Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.
945	I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like "CYA not Calif Youth Admin" is not appropriate.
945	2.
945	We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?
945	Should AReM address this?
945	My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?
945	Is this correct?
945	3.
945	In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?
945	The filing simply asks for no harm.
945	Thanks, Jim
946	The PPO - Power Purchase Option - is a unique program based on the IL restructuring law.
946	Texas has no analogous service.
946	I agree with your statement that we don't need an RTO, we need to fix the physical retail transmission rules.
946	It's important to keep consistent messages.
946	Jim
947	Thanks for our new model.
947	Pls let me know how it is going.
947	Jim
948	Lisa -- I appreciate your note greatly.
948	While we didn't always win, we did always give the other side the fight of their lives.
948	Electricity markets in the Mid-atlantic (and throughout the country) are better for the work you did over the last few years.
948	Best of luck in your future plans.
948	I'm sure that we will talk again, and often.
948	Take care, Jim
949	CA supreme court filing.
950	Thanks.
950	Jim
951	Here are my thoughts.
951	I have to be honest, I'm struggling with the Transco / RTO split.
951	Jim
952	I don't think that I'll send this given the current direction of the PUC to move forward with TX.
952	I do think that these points are important and maybe Jean R. can get them in verbally as appropriate.
952	Thanks, Jim
953	Yes, but I think we may lose that rating.
953	What is the impact if that were to occur?
953	Seems like we should (a) identify our situation given today's environment and (b) identify the impact of one further downgrade.
953	Jim
954	Thanks.
955	Thanks.
955	Probably also want to talk with Brad Nebergald.
955	Jim
956	Janine - Ok for you to cover the whole country.
956	I had forgotten our discussions.
956	Please discuss NM and AZ with Leslie Lawner.
956	Jim
957	Here are my thoughts / issues with the EPSA paper: 1.
957	The EPSA paper indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that FERC Staff proposed.
957	Should EPSA at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed?
957	Gives EPSA an "out" of this recommendation if it proves later that FERC's application of the Delivered Price Test is unworkable.
957	2.
957	I don't understand when EPSA says "Our recommendation, therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power" on page 2 of the draft?
957	Why should EPSA indicate that it is comfortable with a 20% Economic Capacity test to FERC.
957	I would argue that 35% is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position.
957	Also, is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in "real-time"?
957	Having a once and done for three year application is ok, but if we are conditioned that we can't get beyond 20% in any market, what does this do to trading and how would this be reported?
957	3.
957	The discussion on Available Economic Capacity and its implication for having a "bias against new entry" is confusing.
957	Maybe we should clairfy our concerns.
957	4.
957	The argument that ALL new generation is by definition pro-competitive needs to be strengthened.
957	It should be explained in the context of the Delivered Price Test.
957	Also, it that still true if a party which holds 100 MW in a 500 MW market builds a 100 MW power plant - now 200 MW in a 500 MW market?
957	Maybe I am missing something.
957	5.
957	EPSA needs to make the argument that Conditioning MBR on vague rules is wrong and anti-competitive earlier in the paper.
957	This is my biggest concern - that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market "breaks" even though our fundamental presence has not changed.
957	6.
957	I don't understand the EPSA paper on RTO versus non-RTO markets.
957	EPSA endorses something but I'm not sure what?
957	What does this mean if I sell on TVA's network?
957	I appreciate blanket authority, but I wonder about exactly how this would be constructed?
957	Would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority?
957	Also, doesn't this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who don't want competition - if they never set up an RTO they never face competition?
957	Jim
958	I spoke with Ashley yesterday.
958	Awaiting NG's filing.
958	No plans right now.
958	Will keep you in the loop.
958	Jim
959	FYI
960	I probably shouldn't be so serious, but I think the current situation at Enron has made me less fun.
960	Jim
961	Dynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service.
961	IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity.
961	This will impact our ability to "go physical" starting next year.
961	2.
961	MISO vs. ARTO IP is a member of the ARTO.
961	EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region.
961	I think this is why Dynegy won't state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense.
961	No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to "go physical" starting next year in Illinois.
961	3.
961	CTC Bet in ComEd My recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn't happen.
961	Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue.
961	4.
961	Delivery Service Tariff Litigation ComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap).
961	EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP.
961	5.
961	PPO (Power Purchase Option) Termination ComEd is pushing to end the PPO service.
961	PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers.
961	It is the service we use to "deliver" today in ComEd.
961	IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP?
961	6.
961	Relative Size of Current EES Book Hope this helps.
961	Data will improve with more time.
961	Jim
962	The $$# is 530MM
963	sounds like the right approach to me
964	lower rates first - they still don't get it
965	Does this process conform w/ regulatory reqts?
966	yes.
966	just info.
966	may help to have Sue Landwehr on call to hear your thoughts.
967	Rick -- We do have an on-going dispute with the PAPUC about our assessment for gas sales.
967	The charge is $150k.
967	We are suing with others the PAPUC to argue that we are not a utility and therefore can't get assessed.
967	Jim
968	Trying to run down the information.
968	Jim
969	Howard -- Did we deal with the EES letter from NYISO MMU?
969	Pls let me know.
969	Jim
970	FYI.
970	Not sure if we can afford this, but if you think it's helpful let's talk.
970	Jim
971	Thanks for the info guys.
971	Jim
972	Resend
973	Do we need to file on the NOPR on Partial Day Recalls??
973	Will EPSA file?
973	What position will they take?
973	Should we talk with Joe Hartsoe about his position?
973	Jim
974	Sue -- Please follow up with Roskow at the CPUC.
974	I hope that he can get an answer before EOB Monday next week.
974	Please keep me in the loop on this.
974	Jim
975	Got it.
975	Thanks.
975	Jim
976	Was the amendment approved by FERC?
976	Jim
977	FYI.
977	Will you attend the meeting at FERC?
977	Jim
978	Fine.
978	Why not have this as the first element of EISB Wholesale Quadrant??
978	Jim
979	Ray -- Have you looked at the testimony?
979	It appears to be hitting the key points.
979	Is there anything else that we need to be doing to make sure that our case is as strong as possible?
979	Give me a call.
979	Jim
980	Please include as appropriate.
980	Jim
981	Not sure.
981	Probably won't be ready until end of year.
981	Jim
982	Looks good.
982	I agree that making arguments about merchant generation "stranded costs" is questionable, better to couch this as "structural impact on market participants".
982	More importantly, if I bought 50% of generation in one market, and FERC changes their rules, seems like I either (a) sell generation and take the loss or (b) get regulatory risk insurance.
982	FERC has the right to make markets work.
982	Finally, on the issue of blanket authority, I think that the CAISO model is a good example of why this may not work for Enron.
982	In the long-run, as a market-maker, Enron needs workable markets.
982	A good test case would have been this - under FERC's proposed rules, would FERC have granted market-wide waiver in California?
982	If FERC is comfortable with the result, than move ahead.
982	Thanks, Jim
983	Attached is a summary of the SCE meeting to discuss our Negative CTC claim.
983	Call if you would like any additional information.
983	Jim
984	Pls provide John with any further information.
984	Jim
985	If we do take over this type of role, what issues and information would the NYISO be entitled to?
985	We are pushing DG and load curtailment very actively.
985	Jim
986	Melinda -- Let's talk soon.
986	I want to make sure that you understand all of the implications of this decision.
986	Jim
987	Alberto -- Pls ask Sue Mara where these stand.
987	I thought that the FERC didn't approve.
987	Jim
988	Pls send asap the information to have me submit to Rick.
988	Jim
989	Rick -- Andy is looking for about $1500 for tuition reimbursement.
989	I would, if we can afford it, pay this.
989	I indicated that going forward we could not make any committments but finishing his college would be helpful.
989	Thoughts?
989	Jim
990	Sounds good.
990	Maybe we can employ the Gov one last time before the end of the year to try and message a "workable" solution -- let's just decide what that is (maybe some bare minimums on RTOs)?
990	Jim
991	Look at this web site www.southerncompany.com Go to the section "NEWS & ISSUES" section of the web site.
991	They compute the cost of moving an electron from New Orleans to NYC.
991	Jim
992	Rick -- Are you going to put out the new org chart by this Friday?
992	Jim
993	Howard -- How did this mistake happen?
993	Does their tariff allow for restatement of prices?
993	Does this cost the desk $$?
993	Maybe the NYISO shouldn't be doing this?
993	Jim
994	Harry - This is the meeting.
994	Jim
995	This story appears to be about residential.
995	Do we know if C&I has feared so poorly?
995	What are the problems with entering the market for those customers?
995	Have these customers been angry or pleased?
995	Jim
996	The TX MONTHLY story.
996	Jim
997	We should inform FERC Enforcement.
997	No formal filings.
997	Jim
998	Bill -- Joe Hartsoe (Fed Reg Affairs) got cc: on the demand letter from PJM.
998	I assume you have the letter.
998	If not, please let me know - Joe sent me a copy.
998	Jim
999	I'd say $395 is fair.
999	Jim
1000	I would recommend that either Steve or myself call Bittenbender to recommend Kirk House - we met with him on the RTO discussions.
1000	Jim
1001	Thanks.
1002	Thanks.
1002	Jim
1003	We are pulling this together and will talk with Marcus Nettleson as appropriate.
1003	Jim
1004	I still think that Enron should be advocating some form of Negawatt program for non-retail access states.
1004	Using an RTP tariff that more closely tracks the wholesale prices from an RTO balancing energy market with locational signals can be used without any retail access and can have the load response needed to keep prices from skyrocketing - of course this would require a DA market because the signals need to come in ahead of the usage.
1004	By the way, I disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity.
1004	We should make sure that we put this in our comments on RTO Week.
1004	Jim
1005	Great news.
1005	Are there any other MD Commissioners that Ms. McDonald thinks we should visit with?
1005	On the idea of NYISO vs. PJM, I was reading in Restructuring Today yesterday about some elements that NY thought was better than PJM.
1005	I think that we need to "find" three things to give to the NYISO in the development of a single market...allocation of FTRs comes to mind.
1005	I agree that PJM and its staff are the key elements, but maybe getting over this rhetoric will be made easier if we concede that NYISO does something well??
1005	Should we do another round of New England meetings to push our support - with McGreevey winning in NJ, will the NJBPU change its focus?
1005	Jim
1006	Sue & Kerry - Do you know if anyone is going to this?
1006	Should we work with EPSA to publish an EPSA piece that corresponds to this?
1006	Jim
1007	I am beginning to agree with Dave on Governance - that a for-profit TransCo may not be in our best interest.
1007	Let's talk about how to change the wording.
1007	Jim
1008	Wanda -- Can you break out for me the ISO and PX money due?
1008	I need to make sure that our Settlement is consistent with our FERC Refund issues?
1008	Jim
1009	I can attend.
1009	Jim
1010	FYI.
1011	FERC will be the ultimate decider on Admin Cost Adder, not the IURC.
1011	Not sure why this is even in the Settlement except to ensure that IURC won't intWe should not sign based on this information.
1011	Jim
1012	Yes
1013	We need to ensure that the EDI rules are final and allow Enron to switch billing options early next year (see #2 below).
1013	Let me know if there are any issues.
1013	Jim
1014	Are they going to send a new invoice with changed amounts??
1014	Do they know not to do anything going forward?
1014	Jim
1015	Also, we should have a talking point response to the NARUC points (would be good to come from EPSA).
1015	Jim
1016	After the PHC today, we should have a better feel where the parties are and what the discussions will provide for.
1016	Sue, can you make sure that Jeremy and team have a synopsis and outline of next steps.
1016	Thanks.
1017	FYI.
1018	Thanks.
1018	If the May 2002 date starts to slip, pls let me know.
1018	Jim
1019	Let's discuss this afternoon.
1019	Jim
1020	Rick called Lynne Church to discuss maybe having EPSA put out daily "papers" on market issues.
1020	EPSA did this at the FERC RTO Week and it worked very well.
1020	Jim
1021	I didn't say that was ok.
1021	She was to move on Nov 15.
1021	Jim
1022	Help as much as you need to.
1022	Jim
1023	Harry, Janine, & Bob -- Joe Short works on Project Phoenix (rebooking of old EES deals).
1023	He is interested in any analysis that we may have provided related to the Simon Properties deal with the Master Meter issue.
1023	If anyone has any old files on this, please send his way.
1023	Also, any updates on where we stand (e.g., Ohio court cases) would be good.
1023	We probably need to have a review of our rights and obligations so that we can properly book the deal.
1023	After we get Joe our info, we can regroup to determine next steps.
1023	Thanks.
1023	If anyone has any questions, please call.
1023	Jim
1024	Joe -- I forwarded the call from Phil to Bill Bradford and let Kevin Presto know.
1024	If you hear anything else, pls let me know.
1024	Jim
1025	Thanks.
1025	I don't think that I want to travel to Europe right now.
1025	Market opportunities are slowing down.
1025	I think that we'll go to Mom's for some time.
1025	You can always come over through the weekend to see Gracie.
1025	Jim
1026	Thanks.
1027	I saw this recently.
1027	It's true AND funny.
1027	This place is amazing.
1027	Jim
1028	Thanks for the update - I'll keep my fingers crossed.
1028	Jim
1029	Thanks.
1029	It was a nice dinner.
1029	Jim
1030	I think that Christi's write up is great.
1030	I've only changed two things.
1030	If anyone has any more changes, please get to Janel ASAP.
1030	Jim
1031	Pls let me know.
1031	Jim
1032	Thanks for asking.
1032	This is a very strange place.
1032	Our core trading is doing very well.
1032	It appears that management decided to put some huge bets at the Corporate level without any risk management.
1032	I'm doing very well.
1032	Marianna is expecting our 2nd child next May.
1032	Grace continues to grow and become a little person.
1032	Hope you and your family is doing well.
1032	Jim
1033	I don't think that it is one of our top issues.
1033	I'd recommend that we stay out.
1033	Jim
1034	Janet -- Going forward Govt Affairs will coordinate with Services and Product Development (and other EWS and EES groups as appropriate, e.g. Credit) to ensure compliance with (1) licensing/registration, (2) bonding/security, (3) regulatory reporting, and (4) other.
1034	I have asked Gloria Ogenyi to lead this effort for us.
1034	We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with Evan, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).
1034	I fully concur with Rogers that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.
1034	As important, just because we don't want to attract new business in a given market doesn't mean that our responsibilities have ended.
1034	We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.
1034	To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that Gloria be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.
1034	In addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).
1034	I will talk with Gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced.
1034	Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.
1034	I will call you to provide an update on the market review when I have more information.
1034	If you want to talk about this, please call.
1034	Thanks, Jim PS - I'll ask Gloria to give you an update on the IL bonding status.
1035	I didn't know that I was all powerful....
1036	Barbara -- Any decision on the payment?
1036	Jim
1037	Thanks.
1037	It makes sense for Gloria and Rebecca to get together (I am available to talk tomorrow and have asked Gloria to set something up).
1037	Also, we need to work together to make sure that EES' reports, taxes, and other requirements are filed in a timely fashion (with the right internal groups).
1037	On the IL Bond issue, there must be a disconnect between us and the ICC.
1037	The ICC believes that our Bond isn't current.
1037	Maybe we can figure this out together tomorrow?
1037	Call if anyone has any questions.
1037	Jim
1038	Just to keep you in the loop on SCE negotiations.
1038	Jim
1039	Agreed.
1040	FYI
1041	Who will attend and present?
1041	Jim
1042	Should we work through AReM?
1042	Jim
1043	Amr -- Can we use cash as collateral for PJM??
1043	Jim
1044	Can you please add this to the general write-up for each ISO?
1044	Thanks
1045	Pls print and have for my NARUC phone call.
1045	Jim
1046	Can we move it to 3pm??
1047	thanks
1048	Mike -- Ashley Brown called to discuss a meeting with the Stakeholders in Columbus, OH on either Dec 4 or Dec 5.
1048	He would like our participation.
1048	Also, he would like us to let our friends in the industry know about this upcoming meeting.
1048	Thanks, Jim
1049	I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.
1049	Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language - I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission and the Indiana parties.
1049	Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.
1049	Jim
1050	Interesting ideas on Reliant and Orion asset transfer.
1050	Jim
1051	In our discussion of the Duke model, we don't outline when the cap would be set?
1051	Would the Duke model give our traders certainty before the fact and certainty that no refund is due if we don't exceed.
1051	Maybe make this point stronger.
1051	Jim
1052	Janine -- What does this do to our current book of customers on MSG?
1052	Will our $$ margin evaporate?
1052	Is there some other "solution" on how to restructure the FE retail market?
1052	What wholesale issues does FE need to change to help the EWS desk?
1052	Jim
1053	Pls print for my NARUC call.
1053	Jim
1054	No need to prepare anything.
1054	They'll do most of the talking.
1054	Jim
1055	Ok.
1055	But if this case ends up in Settlement, we should have our priorities outlined before the case.
1055	Jim
1056	Attached please find the Nov GA report.
1056	Please call with any questions.
1056	Jim
1057	Please get internal comments from Thane Twiggs, Sue Mara, Steve Walton, Dan Staines, and Dave Perrino before letting Doug go public with this document.
1057	I want to make sure that we are correct in some of our analysis (for example, I think that you may have misinterpreted the FERC in the California discussion).
1057	Jim
1058	Mike -- I'm guessing that Sue and/or Jeff have responded.
1058	The short answer is that there are going to be a number of legal tests before we are "completely" in the clear.
1058	Jim
1059	Thanks.
1059	Let's get together (just you and I) and figure out how we can make sure our teams are working together.
1059	I am sure that you don't want to worry about this stuff any more than I do.
1059	How about for 15 minutes after the EES Op Comm on Monday?
1059	Jim
1060	So the short answer is that EES needs to change its procedures?
1060	Also, is the 50kw right for all markets?
1060	Jim
1061	Had a call from Tribolet.
1061	He agrees (as does Lisa M.) that we need to rationalize our California legal support.
1061	Can we outline our key cases?
1061	Also, my opinion is to continue to use Mike Day but have YOU as the only "point of contact" for approval of work.
1061	Let's talk today.
1061	We will need to talk with Vicki.
1061	Jim
1062	Documents developed for NARUC by Janel, etal.
1062	Jim
1063	I hope you are having fun at the Nutcracker Market.
1063	Tell Christi and Susan hello.
1064	FYI
1065	I like it.
1065	Our argument should be that the MISO is not an Indiana public utility.
1065	I'd put it in the dialogue just to keep from having the process work out poorly.
1065	Jim
1066	Tom -- You may want to go to this event and report back to Susan Lindberg.
1066	It could provide a nice overview of the status.
1066	Jim
1067	Sue -- Did you ever reach Terrie Wheeler?
1067	Jim
1068	We already knew it.
1068	More importantly, I'd extend his thought to every competitive retail market in the US!!!!
1068	Jim
1069	The tough question may be taking a long-term cash committment and transforming it into a single NPV payment (discount rate issues), assuming that is part of the options.
1069	Jim
1070	Pls submit an RCR for me to discuss at today's meeting.
1070	RCR - EPSA SE RTO Study.
1070	$60k.
1070	Jim
1071	Texas gas plan.
1072	Agreed.
1073	Did we want to get off the Creditors Comm.
1074	Thanks.
1075	Then let's proceed with that model.
1075	Someone needs to tell Jean B. not to get involved.
1075	Jim
1076	Your thoughts??
1076	Jim
1077	In what forum will this be discussed?
1077	Jim
1078	How about 9am tomorrow?
1078	Jim
1079	Dave -- I assume you are following this?
1079	Jim
1080	Thanks.
1080	Let me know how the desk sees it.
1080	Also, please make sure that we talk with EES gas (Don Black).
1080	Jim
1081	Thanks.
1082	I want to go down with you.
1082	Thx, Jim
1083	Lisa - While Wanda and I with the FERC team agreed on a process of moving forward, I want to make sure that the documents properly deal with how the FERC haircut will be handled.
1083	When will you have a new version to read?
1083	Jim
1084	thanks
1085	Thanks.
1086	Is everything ok??
1087	Haven't got anything today.
1087	If I get some, I'll send to EPSA.
1087	Thanks.
1088	Any issues for the P/Ls or for Tim Belden in the West?
1088	Jim
1089	Thanks.
1090	FYI.
1090	Also, does the same obligation present itself in Illinois?
1090	Are there any restricitions or obligations on EES as a marketer in IP territory?
1090	Jim
1091	How about Tuesday the 20th?
1091	Should be relatively slow.
1091	Jim
1092	Rick -- I intend to take off the following days for vacation through the year-end.
1092	Mon Nov 26 - Fri Nov 30 (5 days) Wed Dec 26 - Fri Dec 30 (3 days) Thanks, Jim
1093	Elizabeth - Let's please meet this week to update this web site.
1093	Jim
1094	A good summary of current RTO activities.
1094	Jim
1095	A couple of thoughts -- 1.NG is trying to schedule a meeting in Columbus either Dec 4 or Dec 5.
1095	2.I did speak with Ashley.
1095	He indicated that NG has no specific inclination to avoid LMP in the real-time.
1095	He did not, however, confirm that NG was indifferent.
1095	3.I am very concerned with the implication that Mike highlights in his point #1.
1095	NG may simply have misstated its intentions.
1095	But clearly this position makes it difficult for NG to join MISO under Appendix I (they would be giving up too much).
1095	4.I agree that what NG is really saying is a for-profit RTO with ownership of some (but not necessarily all) transmission plant in its footprint.
1095	5.Let's try and coordinate our discussions with Paul Dawson in the London office to gather his thoughts on NG in the UK market.
1095	Luiz - Can you please develop some questions / talking points based on the attached comments that we can transmit to Ashley Brown prior to the meetinThanks
1096	Gary -- Do you still have a contact at Waste Management?
1096	I hear their financial troubles seem to be under control.
1096	Just wanted to start some inquiries?
1096	Jim
1097	Jackie -- Pls send me a copy of the report.
1098	I am trying to identify generation assets owned and/or controlled in ERCOT by Enron and its affiliates.
1098	The information I have been provided is that Enron only has Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners LTD - 263 MW.
1098	Is this correct?
1098	Do we have any long-term capacity over the DC Tie?
1098	Do we have any construction in progress?
1098	Any other positions (e.g., Capacity Auction) that may be considered by the PUCT in the merger?
1098	Is there anyone else I should talk with about this information?
1098	Thanks, Jim
1099	Houston time
1100	We spoke with Roger Yang.
1100	They don't have anything on the shelf.
1100	I started to look at the PG&E web site and figured out that you'd have to have a PhD in Oper Research to re-compute the PX Credit on an hourly basis.
1100	Jim
1101	Harry -- FYI.
1102	Ok to travel.
1102	Jim
1103	Yes.
1103	Have fun.
1103	Jim
1104	Guys -- I understand the differences.
1104	Becky is going to get on the EPSA call tomorrow and tell them that we are ok with the NOPR (and will file as such) and that EPSA should make sure to not blow up the NOPR (or try).
1104	Becky if EPSA wants complete agreement, then they shouldn't file.
1104	Grab me if you want to talk.
1104	Jim
1105	Chip -- The e-mail I referenced in my voice mail.
1105	Please call if you have any information.
1105	Jim
1106	Also, please look at this file.
1107	Thanks Chip.
1107	If you hear anything else, please let me know.
1107	Jim
1108	Isn't Friday the Potluck?
1108	If not - yes.
1108	Otherwise, how about Thursday?
1109	Can I get a copy daily?
1110	Thanks.
1111	Rick -- Let's discuss bad messaging at NARUC meeting at our Thursday meeting.
1111	Jim
1112	My initial take is to keep engaged through Perrino.
1112	I'll try and make the call this Thursday.
1112	Jim
1113	Please arrange a call in # for 4pm Thursday.
1114	We are trying to identify assets and contracted positions that Enron will either own or control in ERCOT to process the PUCT merger analysis.
1114	If you have any information on existing or planned assets or positions please let me know.
1114	If you want to discuss, please feel free to call me at 3x7673.
1114	Thanks.
1114	Jim
1115	Thanks.
1116	Attached is a summary of PG&E's notes on how they calculate the PX Credit (until January 19, 2001 when they hardwired $150/mwh).
1116	We continue to try and get a handle on how the FERC Refund case will impact the PX Credit and Negative CTC.
1116	If anyone has any issues or comments, please let me know.
1116	Thanks.
1116	Jim
1117	I put it together from notes on the PG&E web site.
1117	I may ask Roger to review.
1117	Jim
1118	Jean -- Why not ask Marianne Carroll to draft a short note on the current status of the docket and likely outcomes/timing?
1118	Thanks.
1119	Gloria -- Before we move forward, please talk with Steve Montovano.
1119	Thanks.
1120	Greek -- Here is our current list.
1120	Thanks, Jim
1121	The $$ should come from the business people.
1121	Jim
1122	Great.
1122	I briefly looked at your papers - the idea is very promising if you can find the agency/government.
1122	Jim
1123	My number is 713-853-7673.
1123	See you Tuesday.
1124	Denise -- Do you have a listing of all bonds that EES (and its affiliates) has in place for retail marketing, including wholesale ISOs?
1124	Speaking with Gloria, we don't keep this information in Govt Affairs.
1124	Rebecca Fite keeps bond information required in the State licensing processing.
1124	The place that I think that is missing is Wholesale Service providers (e.g., ISOs).
1124	I think that we need to expand this idea of Bonding to "Financial Guarantees" including with Utilities, States, and Wholesale Service Providers.
1124	Maybe the best way to start is to work backwards from EES active markets and determine what is needed in each locale?
1124	Thanks, Jim
1125	Thanks for the thoughts.
1125	I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.
1125	I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.
1125	On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.
1125	PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to "collect" the overpayment of Negative CTC.
1125	All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.
1125	Jim
1126	Alan -- The only way to collect the "overpayment" is to artificially reduce the PX Credit going forward to thereby allow for more CTC.
1126	Jim
1127	Andy -- I was speaking yesterday with Chuck Ward.
1127	He indicated that we continue to have (or may have soon) litigation surrounding our ownership interest in Cornhusker.
1127	This is important primarily because the Texas Public Utility Code requires that the PUC approve any merger of generators that will have a combined ownership of over 1% - which Dynegy and Enron will have.
1127	I want to make sure that we represent our ownership interest to the PUC appropriately given the current dispute.
1127	If you have any specifics, please let me know or give me a call.
1127	Thanks, Jim
1128	Thanks.
1128	Once done, let's have a phone call with the wholesale electricity team to discuss before sending to Ashley.
1128	Jim
1129	Except that my understanding of the SCE model is that the CTC structure will continue beyond 3/31/02 (and may then apply for PG&E).
1129	I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC "overpayment".
1129	Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC "overpayment"?
1129	On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the "overpayment" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.
1129	Otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks.
1129	Jim
1130	Lisa - Something to think about.
1130	Do we want to try and expand the issues to resolve the Settlement?
1130	Jim
1131	Rebecca -- Pls work through Gloria and Bevin Hunter (in Austin).
1131	My understanding is that PUCT filing deadlines are always 3pm, but Bevin can take it over to the PUCT this evening.
1131	I assume that you will create the report and Gloria will draft a simple cover sheet filing.
1131	Gloria, we may need Marianne Carroll to sign??
1131	Jim
1132	Bob Frank will be coordinating with Services from Govt Affairs.
1133	thanks.
1134	FULLY AGREE.
1135	I assume we are happier with this message?
1136	Thanks for the tip.
1136	Why don't we try to have lunch in early December - I'm going to try and take off the week after Thanksgiving.
1136	Jim
1137	Rick -- Please find attached the asset report in Texas.
1137	Enron's ownership depends on what day the filing is made (for instance, Indian Mesa won't be active until Dec and may be sold immediately).
1137	Also, there is an on-going arbitration with Cornhusker about our ownership right.
1137	Andy Edison has the lead from EWS legal.
1137	Jim
1138	Ray -- Let' s hold a call in early Dec (I don't need to be on the call) where we go through the FERC case for Belden.
1138	Give me a call to discuss.
1138	Jim
1139	thanks
1140	Julie -- Enron would be willing to move forward with the Boston Pacific study (at the $15k) level.
1140	Thanks, Jim
1141	Well.
1141	Haven't they got themselves in a pickle?
1141	Jim
1142	Rick -- Here is the information on staffing and outside services.
1142	Call if you need anything else.
1142	Jim
1143	Thanks.
1144	Before we take this on, let's talk about how it fits into our priorities.
1144	What will be happening that we must cover?
1144	Jim
1145	I am planning on calling in from home.
1145	Do we have a list of issues/states that we want EPSA to focus on?
1145	If you send me your thoughts, I think that we can send to EPSA before the phone call.
1145	My list - 2.
1145	AZ opposition to the APS - Pinnacle West generation "sale" 3.
1145	Continue pushing at state level for NOx fairness in allocation to IPPs 4.
1145	Re-instate Direct Access in California.
1145	Many EPSA members (led by Williams) will fight against direct access.
1145	I won't push hard here.
1145	Jim
1146	Ok.
1146	I agree.
1146	Jim
1147	This means that the DST proceeding moves forward - right?
1147	How about a phone call at 3pm HOUSTON TIME to catch up on all matters?
1147	Jim
1148	Lunch works.
1148	I thin 11:45 is best.
1148	Jim
1149	Attached is the most recent statement from the California Utilities that implements the DA Suspension (filed Friday).
1149	Comments are due Nov 28 (Wed) from parties.
1149	The Utilities continue push for a "hard" deadline of DA.
1149	They also offer an option where Suppliers would be required to submit a Affidavit for incremental DASRs and potentially have the CPUC review the specific contract language.
1149	Of course, in no event do they believe that any customer should be allowed to have DA service if the customer's name was not on our Oct 5 Customer List.
1149	Jeff and I will be talking with Mike Smith (and anyone else who wants to participate) to work through our response to these comments.
1149	Jim
1150	Don't worry.
1150	Appreciate the thought.
1150	Jim
1151	Not sure yet.
1151	We will be talking with AReM and will want your input.
1151	We may have to file but not sure.
1151	Jim
1152	Here are my thoughts -- 1.
1152	Agree that offering Transmission Provider waiver given RTO status is premature.
1152	2.
1152	Maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled Provider of Last Resort type service and bundled Utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition.
1152	At a minimum, in places like PA, where the Utility sales service is a direct competitor, there should be no difference with any competitive player.
1152	In a state like GA, where the Utility sales service is a "monopoly" by statue (i.e., bundled retail), I still think given the ability to cogenerate, it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale.
1152	Maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus.
1152	I fully agree to include these providers in the definition.
1152	3.
1152	Leslie, call Christi N. to discuss examples of how Native Load Exemption has caused problems (we've put in earlier filings).
1152	4.
1152	The question of "Holding Company, etc."
1152	-- We should argue for an exemption.
1152	5.
1152	I am also troubled by the "administer" term.
1152	FERC should prohibit any "helping" by the Transmission Provider of anyone in the marketplace.
1152	Maybe focus FERC on clarifying its positions.
1152	6.
1152	Emergency sections -- Keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry (and could be a real problem given a CAISO type situation - ask Alan Comnes for thoughts).
1152	Probably don't object but want to make sure that if Emergency develops there must a pre-set timeframe for going back to normal business.
1152	7.
1152	Everything filed at the FERC related to Standards of Conduct should be posted on the OASIS.
1152	I didn't understand the final bullet point comments.
1152	Is this policy or a statement of something to come?
1152	Jim
1153	Can we talk this week on our response?
1153	Jim
1154	Does EPSA agree that FERC should require all Transmission Providers should agree to an RTO of the FERC's choosing or lose MBR for all affiliates?
1154	That's the other message Lynne should put out.
1154	Jim
1155	I know that was the plan and we do intend to work with AReM, but we may have to file if our needs aren't met.
1155	Jim
1156	EEMC has filed in MD for a gas license.
1156	It is on the calendar for this Wednesday.
1156	There have been a number of letters sent dealing with "questions" on our license.
1156	Govt Affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the PUC given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record.
1156	We would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues.
1156	If anyone has a significant reason not to pull the item, please let me or Harry Kingerski know as soon as possible.
1156	Thanks, Jim
1157	Harry -- I think that we need to talk with EWS Tariff risk to make sure that we are on the same page.
1157	I am concerned that some of Gloria's statements may not end up happening with the final tariffs.
1157	Please advise.
1157	Jim
1158	I'll call Ashley and relay the message.
1158	Jim
1159	FYI.
1159	Any thoughts?
1160	Janet -- Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.
1160	I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.
1160	Total headcount = 21.
1160	The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).
1160	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1160	Jim
1161	Harry -- Rebecca is ok with pulling the MD license until the issues are corrected.
1161	Also, who is following up on the VA license?
1161	Thanks, Jim
1162	Dan -- I will get with Evan and his team and pull this together.
1162	Of course, much of the activity with Utilities is driven by their requirements and judgements (which change over time).
1162	Jim
1163	Gloria -- Where are we on a matrix of Utility agreements?
1163	Jim
1164	Thanks.
1165	I'll ask around floor.
1165	Given my background, this position does not sound like the best fit - I'd rather be more on the long-term contracting (origination) side or business development.
1165	Thanks for the inquiry.
1165	As you know, things are pretty crazy right now here at Enron.
1165	I intend to take the week off after Thanksgiving and intend to give you a call during that period.
1165	Have a great Thanksgiving.
1165	Jim
1166	Thanks.
1167	How about heading off campus - less likely to run into Enron people.
1167	Let's meet in the parking lot entrance (right where the little store is on the way to the Met) at 11:30.
1167	If anything comes up, call me on my cell at 713-851-2499.
1167	Jim
1168	I would like to take something to Dan Leff by end of business tomorrow.
1168	Whatever we have.
1168	Thanks, Jim
1169	Let's do it at 5pm tonight at Teala's.
1169	Jim
1170	Janet - 1.
1170	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.
1170	While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.
1170	The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
1170	2.
1170	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.
1170	I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
1170	4.
1170	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.
1170	This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).
1170	I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.
1170	Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.
1170	Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.
1170	We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).
1170	Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.
1170	I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.
1170	My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.
1170	Thanks, Jim
1171	Draft.
1172	I would recommend that if we keep Roy Boston we not keep Pat Keene and move Bob Frank to Texas with Roy Boston in the Mid-C.
1172	Jim
1173	As with everything else right now, I take no offense.
1173	It was a pleasure meeting with you.
1173	I wish you all of the best.
1173	Jim
1174	Gloria -- We need to keep this type of information in our matrix on Recent Contact.
1174	Jim
1175	Something to think about -- Topics to be covered in the Texas Intrastate White Paper: 1.
1175	Current state of the Texas Intrastate Market 2.
1175	Areas for improvement 3.
1175	Proposed future state of the Texas Intrastate Market 4.
1175	Strategy for implementation 5.
1175	Actions for implementation a.
1175	Form of transport contract b.
1175	Gas flows in Texas c.
1175	Basis price history
1176	After talking with Dan, I intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning Dec 3.
1176	Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, Harry, Gloria, and Rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.
1176	This, of course, will continue to require help from legal, credit, and operations.
1176	If anyone has any other questions, please give me a call.
1176	Thanks.
1177	EES does not sell power except potential if it overschedules to their retail load and "sells" balancing energy to IP.
1177	I'm not even sure if we are delivering any energy to any customers in the market.
1177	I'll send to Rogers Herndon.
1177	Jim
1178	Thanks.
1179	Please do.
1179	We could discuss on the regular NERC call at 2:30 Tuesdays.
1179	Jim
1180	During the merger, transactions between a regulated company of one of the partners (IP / PGE) should not do business with the other.
1180	If EES or EPMI is buying or selling from IP, please let me know.
1180	Also, if we are delivering to retail load behind the IP market, we may need to make sure that our actions are with the code of conduct.
1180	I don't think that we have to worry much with PGE side because EPMI and EES are already acting within the code of conduct.
1180	Jim
1181	FYI
1182	Check this out.
1182	Jim
1183	Ashley -- First, hope you have great Thanksgiving Holiday.
1183	Luiz Maurer and others put together the following set of questions for NG to potentially discuss at the upcoming meeting or earlier.
1183	If you have any questions, please call me.
1183	Also, Enron will sign on to a petition to for extension of time in the NG/ARTO case (not sure when this is due out).
1183	Some other people were pushing it and with everything going on here at Enron we needed more time to respond.
1183	Please don't take this as a signal that we can't continue to discuss and maybe help find a solution.
1183	Thanks, Jim 1) Profit-RTO - Where does your proposed organization fit in the attached graph in terms of end state ?
1183	Stage III?
1183	Stage IV?
1183	2) Regarding document "Response of National Grid USA to questions posed by the Commission": Does it imply that core, for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process?
1183	Wasn't the NETA design subject to an extensive consultation, even for profit, NG core functions?
1183	3) If each Transco manages it own OASIS, how can we avoid fragmentation (balkanization), pancaking and many other negative aspects and seams that the RTO process is trying to eliminate?
1183	How can you achieve one-stop shopping?
1183	By outsourcing those functions to one single third party?
1183	4) As a follow up question, what are the mechanisms to assure that this "potential" fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in T, particularly in important inter-tie investments?
1183	5) What kind of PBR mechanism are you envisioning for the Transco-RTO?
1183	Are you thinking about including "external" measures such as cost to provide ancillary services, congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing?
1183	6) Are you envisioning an RTO-Transco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested?
1183	Or can the model live with a "light" RTO where part of the assets are divested but others are not (and sign an operating agreement with the RTO. Would your proposed Matrix of RTO Functions (page 9) still be robust under this scenario? 7) Can your proposed RTO model dovetail with an LMP/Congestion Management system based on financial rights?
1183	[Our understanding is that NETA completely reorganized the UK pool.
1183	The UK system now looks like a "self-dispatch" physical rights model] 8) As a follow up of the previous question: Assuming Alliance adopts a self-dispatch, physical rights approach similar to the one NG operates in the UK today.
1183	Don't you think that this will create significant barriers/seams with other neighboring RTOs, considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch, LMP and financial rights for most RTOs in the US?
1183	9) If your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch, LMP/financial rights, shouldn't some functions in your "Martix of RTO Functions" be collapsed?
1183	For example: management of congestion prices, calculation of congestion, operations of energy markets and generation redispatch?
1183	10) Procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non-core.
1183	However, in the UK system, this represents a significant role of the Transco, with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement.
1183	Is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the RTO and consequently will be part of the PBR formula?
1183	11) Generation interconnection.
1183	Obviously, your proposal did not go that far.
1183	Conceptually, do you favor a system whereby T fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the UK model whereby fixed costs (use of the system) are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component (and connection costs are treates separately, according to a shallow method? 12) Establishment of transmission rates.
1183	How to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the Transco itself will establish its T rates?
1183	Are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities?
1183	13) You stated that separation and control of T assets persists, to a large extent, in the Collaborative Model proposed as part of the Southeast Mediation.
1183	Do you think that the Independent System Administration model is superior in this regard?
1183	What are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models
1184	Molly -- Please let either Gloria or Harry know if you need our assistance.
1184	Jim
1185	Nice to meet your brother.
1185	Do you have a map of the 25th?
1185	Jim
1186	Thanks.
1187	Yes this gets at my issues.
1187	I want to build your matrix and Rebecca's together.
1187	No where do we deal with reporting yet?
1187	Also, we need to have some systematic approach to updates and naming "point people".
1187	Jim
1188	I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).
1188	Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.
1188	Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?
1188	Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?
1188	We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.
1188	Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.
1188	Jim
1189	Christi -- I'm out next week.
1189	This is a bit touchy with the changes coming.
1189	Why not have Jose agree to go (no one else) and if necessary we'll backfill.
1189	Jim
1190	My thoughts -- 1.
1190	Great job.
1190	2.
1190	I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time -- The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs.
1190	3.
1190	Thanks for getting in "Network Plus" - it's the little things that matter.
1190	4.
1190	Maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough - real integration across seams is imperative.
1190	NY and PJM have same tariff same model but haven't worked well for a long time.
1190	Thanks.
1191	LUIZ -- Attached is a version that I changed.
1191	Mainly formattting the intro.
1191	I think that our current draft is too long without a short synopsis up front.
1191	We want a White Paper that reads like an advocacy piece.
1191	Please add to whatever you are doing.
1191	Also, move forward with contacting Larry Ruff for (1) his analysis of your and my combined draft and (2) a simple affadavit on this.
1191	Govt Affairs will pay up to $10k for this work out of our current budget.
1191	We need to have this finished by Tuesday EOB.
1191	CHARLES -- We need to make sure that Monday and Tuesday someone calls everyone on the Committee considering changing these rules on Thursday.
1191	Let's get the list and start lobbying actively.
1191	Call me if you have any questions.
1191	Please talk with Doug Gilbert-Smith about who and where.
1191	Maybe Christi and Jean Ryall can help.
1191	CHRISTI -- Pls make sure that Steve Walton and Sarah Novosel are ok with this statements.
1191	Thanks.
1191	Jim
1192	Ginger -- Can you please approve?
1192	Jim
1193	It's been amazing.
1193	Jim
1194	Pls pay.
1195	No.
1196	Jaime, Please add James Steffes, user id is jsteffe, to the App_BlackBerry group for BB usage.
1196	Thank you for your help, Matthew Campbell
1197	PSE&G called yesterday to ask for an LC or cash collateral of $1.0 MM to displace our Corporate Guarantee of $1.3 MM.
1197	They are sending more information in a letter to Bill Bradford copied to me.
1197	THere is a 5 day turnaround - early next week this will be due.
1198	Yes.
1198	He is now a big-time headhunter.
1198	I hope you had a great Thanskgiving.
1198	Things are crazy here.
1198	Jim
1199	Let's talk early next week.
1200	Right now we are trying to develop some info and the right messages.
1200	This is the same everywhere.
1200	Our gameplan right now is to work this next week.
1200	Jim
1201	Bob -- We need to pull together the rules, etc. for a change in assignment w/o consent for small commercial in NYC and TX by 3 pm tomorrow (or earlier).
1201	Grab me and we can discuss.
1201	Jim
1202	We will need to let everyone know early next week - working on msg Jim Steffes Enron
1203	Wade - Anywhere that we have Supplier Consolidated Billing Enron put up some form of credit to cover 45+ days of Utility charges.
1203	So while I am unsure of the form of collateral, if Evan provides a list of where we are doing Supplier Consolidated Billing, we should be able to construct a Collateral Obligation worksheet.
1203	We also have collateral in each ISO (NE-ISO, NYISO, PJM, CAISO).
1203	It will take some time to de-DASR to Dual Billing and until our accounts switch, the Utilities will hold the Collateral.
1203	Jim
1204	Jim
1205	Christi & Sarah -- Do we have to do something related to this?
1205	Thanks.
1205	Jim Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide.
1205	What this means is that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes to be erratic wholesale markets.
1205	Reportedly, some 30 companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes they exert market power.
1205	The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission determines that market manipulation has occurred.
1206	Did you hear anything on WM?
1206	Jim
1207	Julie -- Given our current situation at Enron, I wanted to let you know that we will not be able to support the SE RTO Study.
1207	I assume that you were already thinking this.
1207	This upcoming week should prove to be another amazing ride.
1207	As soon as we come up for air, I'll call and fill you in on the developments.
1207	Thanks, Jim
1208	Thanks.
1209	This is the price tag for COBRA from Enron.
1209	Looks like $600/month.
1209	Jim
1210	FYI.
1210	Jim
1211	Dick -- With everything going on at Enron these days, please use the following contact information - Jim Steffes Thanks, Jim
1212	FYI
1213	Please call me at 713-853-7673 to assist with any questions.
1213	Jim
1214	Please keep me in the loop on developing opportunities.
1215	Pls send to Mike Terraso with Environmental Policy.
1215	Jim
1216	I would recommend that all letters as such should go to Harry and me.
1216	I think we will be getting a number of these.
1216	I would say that we will try and communicate something proactively to the PUCs around the country by Wed am.
1216	Critical that our message is consistent and clear.
1216	Rebecca, any thoughts?
1216	Jim
1217	Jeff -- Please don't forget to get load #s or de-DASR customers - probably 50+%.
1217	Good info to cover our "remaining" customers.
1217	Jim
1218	FYI.
1218	Let's deal with this early tomorrow.
1218	Jim
1219	Harry -- EES filed yesterday.
1219	My thought is to focus on keeping our licenses so that we can return customers in an orderly fashion.
1219	Jim
1220	Mike -- Going forward, should all enviro be sent to you?
1221	Please send all questions on environment to Mike Terraso.
1221	Thanks.
1222	Evan Hughes are we Dual Billing our current ConEd customers?
1222	Gloria Ogenyi will we owe more $$ if we don't switch to Dual Bill?
1222	Scott Gahn what are the issues if we do switch?
1222	Thanks.
1223	Pls hold for inclusion in CPUC letter today.
1223	Jim
1224	Thanks.
1224	I've enjoyed working with you and more importantly, getting to know you.
1224	Best of luck going forward.
1224	If you ever need any thing, please don't hesitate to call me.
1224	Jim
1225	Thanks Becky.
1225	I've truly enjoyed getting to know you better as we've worked closer these past few months.
1225	You've taught me alot about natural gas issues and if I can ever do anything for you please let me know.
1225	Jim
1226	Thank you Jim Steffes Enron
1227	Appreciate the thoughts.
1227	I especially appreciate your hard work over these last few weeks.
1227	Jim
1228	Sandy -- Pls forward final CPUC letter sent today to this group.
1228	Thanks.
1229	FYI.
1230	FYI
1231	Kay -- A couple of things -- 1.
1231	Jim Steffes not Jeff Steffes 2.
1231	My cell phone is 713-851-2499 not 2489.
1231	Thanks.
1232	Jeff pls call Bryan Gottfredson at 713-942-7307 to discuss possible job openings in CA.
1233	No Yeung + Lindberg are gone Jim Steffes Enron
1234	In speaking to the PUC today, they are under the impression that we are currently physically serving Compaq and JC Penney.
1234	Is this right?
1234	If so, don't we want to deDASR them?
1234	Jim
1235	In OH I believe that the MSG service continues (transfers with the customers) so it's just any discount we gave above the MSG rate.
1235	Jim
1236	Good news.
1236	Also, Rich Drom called from PJM wanting to know if someone from Enron was attending the Members Mtg this Thursday (no) and if what did we want to do with the confidentiality of our credit (I think that we should agree - not PJM's to distribute).
1236	Your thoughts - I'll call Drom back tomorrow.
1236	Jim
1237	Thanks Ann.
1237	Pls send to me going forward (at least as long as we're here).
1238	Jeff -- Pls call.
1239	I agree.
1239	In fact, in the conversation with the Chairman of PUCT, I told him that we were sending all of our pilot load back to TXU before Jan 1.
1239	Jim
1240	Christi -- I want to call Susan tomorrow and let her know about the mess up on her.
1240	But I want her to understand the issues involved.
1240	Let's talk as soon as possible.
1240	Jim
1241	Your message was forwarded to me regarding Dan Allegretti and NPCC.
1241	Can you please let me know what Dan's role was in the organization and any other information?
1241	Thanks, Jim Steffes
1242	Don -- Sempra called today and said we had been nominating but not delivering any gas since Saturday.
1242	Customers are on penalty gas.
1242	What is the story?
1242	Should we just put these customers back to the Utility and let them find another marketer?
1242	Jim
1243	Sandy -- Can you please send all letters sent under Dan's name to him tomorrow.
1243	You may want to send to Esmeralda.
1243	Thanks.
1243	Jim
1244	Call u later Jim Steffes Enron
1245	Jim Steffes Enron
1246	I don't understand what is happening - on the earlier list, Susan and Charles weren't on it.
1246	If you want to discuss this, please call me today.
1246	Jim
1247	Charles and Susan are in the building.
1247	Robert where can I find you to discuss some issues?

1248	Jim Cunningham Managing Director 230 Park Avenue South New York, NY 10003-1566 United States of America
1249	Christi -- Who in ENA leadership could we talk with about finding a "champion" for Gus Engheim (environmental permitting), Bob Frank and Harry Kingerski?
1249	Steve Kean is talking to Ben Jacoby about Gus.
1249	Who else - maybe Scott Neal on gas for Harry Kingerski and Bob Frank?
1249	Let me know.
1249	Jim
1250	Peggy -- Have we done anything on this messaging?
1250	Jim
1251	Delete last sentence Jim Steffes Enron
1252	Rick - Please be advised that James D. Steffes will replace Tom Hoatson as Enron's representative to the PJM Members Committee.
1252	Thank you, Vice President, Government Affairs Enron Corp
1253	Sam behrens can help Jim Steffes Enron

1257	Will call.
1257	Tomorrow approval ok Jim Steffes Enron

1259	Jim Steffes Thanks
1260	Yes.
1260	Thank you.
1260	Jim Steffes
1261	Amy -- I am surprised about Dasovich already getting something.
1261	I would recommend the following amounts.
1261	Comnes $0 (started late last year) 50,000 Can we talk tomorrow to finalize?
1261	Pls give me a good time.
1261	Jim
1262	Amr -- Hope things are well.
1262	I saw a notice for a meeting on Caribbean Energy Jan 31, 2002 in Miami by CBI.
1262	The information is at www.cbiglobalenergy.com.
1262	Thought maybe you'd want to go and flash yourself around.
1262	Take care, Jim
1263	I don't have her number but call San DIego and ask for Sempra.
1263	Jim Steffes Enron
1264	Call Greg Sharp Jim Steffes Enron
1265	Cpuc sent ltr on switching - I'll fax Jim Steffes Enron
1266	I don't know Aldie Warnock.
1266	Thanks for the idea, but I'm going to try and get out of the regulatory world.
1266	Might as well try my hand making $.
1266	I know John Orr and John Meyer.
1266	Not sure about going back to the traveling of RTO world.
1266	Let me think on it.
1266	Let's still do lunch sometime next week.
1266	Thanks.
1266	Jim
1267	Thanks Jim Steffes Enron
1268	There was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.
1268	To make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) -- 1.
1268	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).
1268	2.
1268	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms TXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.
1268	Reliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.
1268	3.
1268	If the customer does not pay their bill, they will then be placed on POLR service.
1268	4.
1268	The AREP offers month-to-month service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation.
1268	5.
1268	Next opportunity to DASR these customers will be Dec 16, 2001.
1268	6.
1268	When we find a buyer for the Texas book or all of the company, EES intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-Price to Beat customers.
1268	This implies that we will not be sending out the Opt-Out provision to non-Price to Beat customers.
1268	Jim
1269	Thanks Marianne.
1269	We've been in contact with the PUC but we will need some help next week.
1269	Are you in Monday?
1269	Jim
1270	I don't know of any EES collateral at PJM.
1270	Very small position in PECO territory.
1270	Jim
1271	FYI
1272	Angela -- To follow up on our discusion about TX customers (e.g., Home Depot), are there any other customers that you are going to include in the sales effort (not including CA)?
1272	I want to make sure that we include these customers in our analysis.
1272	Thanks
1273	By "these customers" you mean the non-mass market - ie, Home Depot?
1273	Jim
1274	Monday is better Jim Steffes Enron
1275	Great.
1275	Jim
1276	Sue - Lyndon's info is: Happy Holidays, Jim
1277	Once again, Enron shows that it has the best damn reg affairs team in the world - maybe universe.
1277	Thanks, Jim
1278	Steve -- Christi left you off this list.
1278	Please include your thoughts on this worksheet as well for Eastern gas.
1278	Thanks, Jim
1279	No. We worked with Paul in the Indianapolis office.
1279	Jim
1280	Friday 10am is best with me.
1280	Pls include Christi Nicolay and Susan Lindberg.
1280	Jim
1281	Or doing some interviewing Jim Steffes Enron
1282	Christi pls send spreadshet Jim Steffes Enron
1283	Call Jeff Brown - he use to work there Jim Steffes Enron
1284	To follow-up on NEPOOL matters -- Last week, the NEPOOL Members Comm did not take any action against Enron.
1284	I received a call today (that I intend to return tomorrow) from Dave Doot - NEPOOL Secretary.
1284	He would like to have a phone call with Enron's attorneys and credit people to figure out how to manage our credit issues going forward.
1284	The reason there was no action last week was because NEPOOL hoped that they could work something out.
1284	I do not know what the bills are for EES/EEMC/EPMI?
1284	I will call Dave Doot and find a good time for later this week when I can arranage a call with the appropriate people.
1284	Call with any other questions.
1284	Jim
1285	Harry -- Let me write-up some things on this and will send to you.
1285	Hope everyone is well.
1285	Jim
1286	Maureen -- Thanks for the information on the switching of the "held" customers.
1286	We will process through a standard EDI transaction.
1286	I am trying to find out who would work up the credit amount.
1286	When I find out, I'll e-mail you.
1286	Thanks, Jim
1287	Marcus and Ed can we talk today about this.
1287	Is there a good time?
1287	I need to get back with NEPOOL today.
1287	Also, while our business dropped off, I am guessing that NE-ISO has been arranging energy for our UI load and our payable is growing pretty quickly.
1287	Jim
1288	Didn't know about this.
1288	Have we compared this list to our gas market termination list?
1288	Jane - Can you please send me the list?
1288	Jim
1289	Customers we will start to de-DASR probably next week.
1289	VERY CONFIDENTIAL
1290	I see that UC/CSU is on this list.
1290	Have any buyers been interested in their load?
1290	Jim
1291	Someone from CSC was on the call (Allison Hafner).
1291	TXU said the meters were to be read by Dec 13 with final EDI files sent to ERCOT by Dec 14.
1291	ERCOT would process a REP of Record change on Dec 13.
1291	Looks like everything is ok.
1291	Jim
1292	I will review the list.
1292	But I need someone from gas team and someone from power team to help.
1292	Let's talk at 9am meeting tomorrow.
1292	Jim
1293	Can we get together this afternoon to discuss calling NEPOOL?
1293	How about 3pm?
1293	Jim
1294	Let's meet at Christi's desk on ebS5 and find a conference room.
1294	Jim
1295	Suzanne -- Becky Cantrell had entered Enron into a number of dockets before FERC related to pipeline rate and other matters (not sure if there were protests).
1295	I would greatly appreciate you coming over to 47 and going through a number of filings so we can either (a) stay in the case or (b) remove our name as an active party.
1295	Elizabeth Linnell has the papers on 47.
1295	My initial thought is that Enron does not need to continue in these cases, but the NewCo will want to understand what to join after formation.
1295	We may want to talk with commercial types to gauge their thoughts.
1295	Please let me know if you can take care of this.
1295	Thanks, Jim
1296	Paul -- I have no information as discussed below.
1296	Jim
1297	Mary Lynne -- Is this for both EES and EEMC?
1297	Is EPMI in this bill?
1297	Can we pay separately by company?
1297	Jim
1298	Doug -- The PUCT called out of the blue and indicate that they would like to talk with you about this information.
1298	Have they communicated with you about this?
1298	Jim
1299	They would like to talk to you.
1299	Jim
1300	FYI
1301	Please add so we can get to Fallon on Monday.
1301	Jim
1302	Doug -- It seems to me that keeping the PUC somewhat appeased makes sense.
1302	I'll try and get some formal questions, but sooner or later they will want to talk directly.
1302	I appreciate that this is a pain, but maybe it's a good opportunity to push to get rid of balanced schedules?
1302	Let's sit down on Thursday am and talk.
1302	Jim
1303	Please comment ASAP.
1303	Want to get to Fallon.
1303	Jim
1304	PJM sent a bill for the 2002 Annual Fee (for $5000).
1304	Upon paying the fee, EPMI will be able to access E-Schedules.
1304	PJM is looking for payment on December 20, 2001 along with our November grid payment.
1304	I assume that no Enron company will need the E-Schedule system after January 1 and therefore we will not be making this payment?
1304	Please advise.
1304	Jim
1305	Also have we returned our physical PJM customers yet?
1305	Jim
1306	With the cancellation of a number of Surety Bonds by our providers, we are faced with a potential credit crunch in NEPOOL.
1306	Also, it is my understanding (although I haven't seen anything) that our Nov 2001 bills are due in all of the markets on Dec 20, 2001.
1306	Christi and I are trying to work out our payment plans (if any) and other requirements to keep our books afloat.
1306	We need to have support on understanding any payment obligations (and bills if we have them) and issues (e.g., Annual Fees).
1306	Who can we talk with for each market?
1306	Thanks, Jim
1307	FYI.
1307	Call if you need anything.
1307	Jim
1308	Jim -- Here is a quick and dirty overview.
1308	Please let me know if you need anything else.
1308	Jim
1309	Lisa and Dave -- Are you the right people to discuss payment or modified credit terms for EPMI?
1309	The issue with NEPOOL is that our UI/CMP/NSTAR wholesale reqts deals would be harmed if we don't pay these guys.
1309	I don't know if we should pay, but I need to figure out who is on point for paying if that decision is reached.
1309	I know that John Llodra is trying to sell these positions.
1309	Jim
1310	Bob -- Please follow up with Juan so we can ensure coverage.
1310	Jim
1311	Mary -- I need to know the other bonds that aren't cancelled.
1311	Are there more?
1311	Jim
1312	Come to 9am mtg Jim Steffes Enron
1313	FYI.
1313	Thought you'd be interested.
1313	Jim
1314	I am trying to pull together a list of the pre-petition and post-petition claims against EES and EEMC (and EPMI where collateral may exist as one entity) as well as any other obligation in the key power and gas markets.
1314	I hope to have this tomorrow.
1314	Jim
1315	Let's talk tomorrow.
1315	Jim
1316	Wade - There may also need to be another $100k for EESI.
1316	Jeff is checking.
1316	Jim
1317	Chris - I did discuss Enron's payment issues with PJM with our team.
1317	To make sure that we are on the same page.
1317	1.
1317	No additional collateral is required at this time.
1317	3.
1317	The Annual Fee is also due on 12/20/01 = $5,000 (one fee for all affiliated companies).
1317	I will call you tomorrow.
1317	Jim
1318	ISO-NE is seeking the following by December 20, 2001 to continue Enron's presence in the market -- Amount Due $2.1 MM Amount Due $6.2 MM 1.
1318	We are verifying these figures (ISO-NE may have EES and EPMI Amount Due reversed) 2.
1318	The process post 12/20/01 is unclear - not sure if Enron companies can schedule without posting Security 3.
1318	Surety Bonds have been revoked and Safeco/Fireman's sent notices that Bonds can not be used for post-petition claims I can't imagine that Enron will post collateral in these amounts.
1318	In the CAISO market, Enron has 3 days of projected expenses as Security coupled with a going-forward power supply.
1318	May be an alternative worth considering?
1318	Any other questions, please call me at 3x7673
1319	How do I take care of this?
1319	Jim
1320	Ed -- Can you please draft a letter (similar to what Paul Darmitzel sent to gas LDCs) to send to PECO Thursday to indicate that placing our physical load customers on bundled POLR service is not objectionable to EES?
1320	We have a bill due in PJM this Thursday that may not get paid.
1320	If we don't pay PJM on Thursday, our brief analysis of the PA Supplier Tariff is that PECO can pull these customers back.
1320	The customers in PECO are GNO (e.g, Suiza), so not sure what the contract issues would be - maybe Michelle can help here.
1320	My understanding is that the contracts should allow EES to serve using Utility power, so we should still have the right to determine to reject or not.
1320	Please let me know if you can do this and if there are any issues.
1320	Thanks, Jim
1321	Troy -- A few questions -- 1.
1321	The counterparty "PGE" - is that Pacific Gas & Electric or Portland General Electric?
1321	2.
1321	When do you think that you would have the "Unknown" researched?
1321	3.
1321	I assume that the costs associated with ERCOT or CAISO are captured in the EPMI and ENA payables?
1321	Thanks.
1322	Ed is drafting the letter and coordinating with Michelle.
1322	Jim
1323	My understanding is that Jim Wood is making the recommendation on Etown.
1323	Correct?
1323	Jim
1324	Dave -- I wish you and your family all of the best.
1324	May you have a happy and prosperous New Year.
1324	Please keep in touch.
1324	Jim
1325	Diann - Sorry about all of this confusion regarding residential customers.
1325	This guy was listed on the Ken spreadsheet (about T&D bills) as being an EES customer in November.
1325	Is this a residential account?
1325	Thanks, Jim
1326	Janet -- FYI.
1326	I intend to take vacation this Friday, all of next week, and Dec 31.
1326	Unfortunately, Harry Kingerski, Bob Frank, Jeff Dasovich,and Christi Nicolay will also be on vacation.
1326	If something urgent comes up, you can call me at home (281-759-8270) or on my cell (713-851-2499).
1326	Thanks, Jim
1327	Thanks.
1327	Diann, I know that the last few months (year?) has been tough on all of us.
1327	I appreciate everything you've done.
1327	Thanks.
1327	Jim
1328	Does everyone have access to the O Drive / Public Affairs directory?
1328	I'd like to keep an external contact list (PUCs, Utilities, etc.) and any material we are creating (files, documents, etc.) in this area so the entire team has access in case someone is out for the day.
1328	To get into this, go to MY COMPUTER, find the O Drive and then find the Public Affairs folder.
1328	If you don't have access, please let me know.
1328	Thanks, Jim P.S.
1328	If I don't get to speak directly with everyone, I hope that y'all have a safe and happy Holiday Season!
1328	See you in the New Year.
1329	Paul -- Why so "unhappy"?
1329	Isn't this the best time of your life?
1329	I know that I am truly looking forward to telling my grandkids that I not only worked at Enron, but I survived the "collapse".
1329	Don't worry about the O drive thing - I'll take care of it.
1329	Jim
1330	Wade - I would recommend that no one pay.
1330	The wire instructions are at the bottom of the earlier e-mail.
1330	The $ are pre-petition.
1330	Thanks.
1331	Ed -- I'll put in a call to discuss with them the contact point.
1331	Jim
1332	May need to post TX PUC collateral.
1332	Jim

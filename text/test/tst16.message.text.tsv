0	Bonnie White is the attorney.
0	I have already called her to find out what our collection process is (if any).
0	I know some guys named Guido and Mario who'll be happy to do it for 50% of the money.
0	I'll let you know what I find out.
1	This is already pretty much done I believe.
1	Let me check with Steve Dickerson and I'll let you know.
2	Hi everyone!!
2	For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is Kevin Hyatt.
2	I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.
2	You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an interest in serving on the committee.
2	Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4 sessions and each session's speaking topics.
2	The track and topics were developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee members and the Trade Fair Group staff.
2	Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15 (highlighted in red).
2	If you move your cursor over the topic, the comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we are trying to present for the conference attendees.
2	I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only confirmed one from Calpine.
2	What I need each of you to do is review the agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the topic, then call them to see if they are interested.
2	Speeches should last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.
2	If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.
2	Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair Group confirming their attendance.
2	Thanks for your help.
2	Don't hesitate to call me (713-853-5559) or Carrie Shapiro (713-463-9595 x307) with any questions!!
3	the first EP one (Line No. 2000) went in service in August.
3	The 2nd one (line 2000 Power up) is the one they didn't get very many takers on in the open season that closed 8/2/01.
4	I have it penciled in for 3pm on thurs 10/25.
4	Wednesday afternoon looks ok too.
4	Friday I may be travelling.
4	Just let me know if you need to move it.
4	Susan can view everyone's calendar and locate a time that works for everyone.
5	Are you going this weekend?
5	I plan on going on Sunday without the boys just to see how many guys actually show up.
5	We saw some big ducks at Flatwoods Sunday morning.
5	The boys got off some shots early but didn't hit anything.
5	By 8:30 am, everything quit flying.
5	let me know,
6	Can I get an instruction booklet for a model 1560 (serial 1650338)?
6	Please send to: Kevin Hyatt 18715 Hickory Ashe Dr Also, my unit keeps flashing "L" and beeping after being plugged in for only a few minutes and I can't get it to quit.
6	Do I need to reset the unit?
6	I'm assuming the "L" means Laser detected.
6	thanks
7	that was a good one!!
8	but did he pass the drug test?
8	Good for him.
8	I hope he makes it thru boot camp.
8	Have fun on your trip.
8	I was going to ask you for a ride home tomorrow but you won't be here.
8	I'm selling the Maxima to Cathy Corbin for her son.
8	Now if I can get the stock price up, I may actually be able to afford a truck.
8	Have you seen the new Dodge-- way cool!!
9	According to Bonnie White, the time period for Oasis to appeal ends on Friday 11/2.
9	If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.
9	This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.
9	Let me know if you have questions.
10	Dear Dr. Lay-- Thank you for your presentation yesterday.
10	As always, you handled very well some tough questions in a very trying time for Enron.
10	I was literally mortified when I heard the "crack" question-- but I think you handled that well too.
10	As a 17-year Enron veteran, the question made me truly ashamed to be associated with the co-worker who asked the question.
10	Hindsight is always 20/20.
10	I'm sure you must know that the majority of Enron's employees don't feel the same way as this one individual.
10	Thanks for your continued hard work and support.
10	Kevin Hyatt Director, Asset Development
11	Is that "instant bam" an offer or just a suggestion?
11	I hear a mattress comes standard with every new truck purchase.
12	click in "index history" below so see historical pricing
13	looks good
14	Sun Devil is going well.
14	We're working to get contracts closed for the shippers going to Phoenix.

16	is at 2pm.
16	I can do it at 8am if we need to, but would prefer 2pm.
16	Let me know please.
17	the link above talks about vertebroplasty - a cement injected to help fractured bones.
17	It may not be helpful to you as your's is disc related, not bone.
17	My neighbor had this procedure done by Dr. Twyford out of Baytown San Jacinto Methodist hospital.
18	Nancy-- any word on the El Paso shipper comments that were due on 10/15.
18	El Paso is to file its reply today 10/26.
18	thanks
19	Carrie Mr. Colin Wilkes from General Electric Power Systems has agreed to present for NGI Session C on 3/20.
19	He will cover two topics including "Changing gas quality specs and their impact to turbines" and "Pressure Reliability".

19	Contact info is as follows: Mr. Colin Wilkes General Electric Building 40, Room 517 1 River Road Schenectady, NY 12345 Also, when you, me and Dave met at the P.O.
19	DoubleTree, Dave mentioned an article he saw dealing with LNG gas specs and their impact to gen units.
19	He was going to try and get me a copy of the article and check into whether or not the author would want to present at the conference (at least that's my recollection).
19	Can you follow up with Dave to see if he's had any success?
19	thanks
20	Jose, Mr. Colin Wilkes from GE in Schenectady has agreed to speak on the topics below.

21	Hi Stacey-- Hope everything is going well for you guys and you are staying busy (considering our current economic slide).
21	Have you seen Enron stock prices lately?
21	I've kicked myself everyday since January for not taking your job offer.
22	When: Thursday, November 01, 2001 11:30 AM-12:30 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
22	Hey, I need to re-schedule.
22	I am a co-chair for the Enron Kids Committee and we have a meeting over lunch on this same day.
22	sorry-
23	Carrie-- Mike Nelson, Vice Pres of Pipeline Integrity for Enron, has agreed to speak at NGI Session A on Pipeline Infrastructure Security.
23	Mike can be contacted via the following: Mr. Michel Nelson Enron Transportation Services PO Box 1188 Suite 3AC3101 Please send him a conf invite at your earliest convenience.
23	thanks
24	Attached are the notes for your meeting in Albuquerque.
24	Please avoid discussing the cost figures (it tends to reach competitive ears).
24	If anyone has any questions, or any competitive intelligence on the Sonoran project, please have them call me.
24	thanks
25	yes please.
25	thanks
26	Hi Wayne, thanks for the reply.
26	It would be great if you could develop something for item 5.
26	I think Orlando Alvarado is having difficulty getting anyone from Williams signed up for it.
26	As for item 6, I may have an interested party for that one but I'll keep you posted.
26	thanks again,
27	Mike- I will need to rechedule as I will be out of town that day.
27	What about sometime either 11/15 or 16?
27	thanks Kevin Hyatt
28	that will work, I'll put it down.
29	that's pretty cool stuff.
29	When I get some money again, I'd like to build a nice layout up in our library or maybe a bigger one in the garage.
30	Kevin-- As we discussed yesterday, Panda Energy International, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc. (Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.
30	The partnership may be called "Panda Gila River L.P."
30	Here are some of the details as we know them: All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%) $2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge) Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale 50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot market What we want to know is: How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract?
30	(And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant's needs) How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?
30	What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?
30	Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.
30	We are scheduled to meet with Panda in Dallas on Tuesday 11/6.
30	thanks for the help.
30	Kevin Hyatt
31	thanks for the update on the Cougar.
31	I need to try and see him this weekend.
32	Estimated annual storage costs are $15mm if my math is correct.
33	thanks Buzz, this helps alot.
34	Lorna, were you able to get a copy?
35	Couldn't another explanation be that the Board DID UNDERSTAND the partnership transactions and were comfortable with the deals once the Chinese Walls and protections were put in place?
35	I don't believe the Board members would shirk their responsibilities (as you pointed out, most of the members have more than the average expertise to understand the transactions) if for no other reason than not taking the chance in possibly sullying their individual reputations by not properly vetting the deals.
36	I am out of the office travelling 11/12, returning 11/13.
36	Let me know if you have an alternate time/day and what topic you would like to meet about.
37	The "revised" bear looks better, a little softer, more cuddly.
37	I'd do the revised version.
38	FYI, I will be out of the office on Monday11/12 but will plan on working the lobby the remainder of next week.
38	thanks
39	Ron, can you please verify for me the delivery pressure in pounds for volume off the Sun Devil project at the juncture of Panda's lateral at the El Paso interconnect outside of Phoenix?
39	Using Doug's cost scope from 9/28/01, are we at 600# or something different?
39	This was the scope with the 36-inch Phoenix lateral.
39	thanks
40	Carrie, FYI
41	What would be the pressure if we don't install stations 1.5 and Kingman?
41	My thinking is we might not have enough market at Cal Border to require those stations.
42	Hi Harvey-- As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.
42	The conference will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.
42	Website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.
42	Primary attendees are electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment suppliers.
42	One of our proposed speaking topics is "LNG - a new role in North American supply."
42	A concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs.
42	The Committee feels LNG can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.
42	I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.
42	They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.
42	After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you.
42	Thanks for the help!
42	Kevin Hyatt
43	James & David -- Can the two of you coordinate a revenue model for Sun Devil that incorporates a Straight - Fixed Variable rate design along the following parameters using 15, 20 and 25 year terms: San Juan utilization: 85% of 780,000/MMBtu/d Mainline: 85% utilization of 810,000/MMBtu/d Phoenix lateral: 75% utilization of 500,000 MMBtu/d Also, prepare some ROE sensitivities if the above utilization falls by 10% and rises by 10%.
43	I will be out of town till Tues 11/13.
43	Can we get together that morning and review your analyses?
43	page me if you have questions at 888-582-7421 thanks
44	Hey congrats!!
44	on the new job.
44	Need any more people?
45	Carrie, see Harvey's message below and send him the speaking invitation.
46	I tried to call you last week but you were with a customer.
46	At this point I have sold my Maxima but with the current Enron environment and poor stock market, I'll continue waiting to purchase any new vehicle at this point.
46	It may be after the first of the year before I do anything.
47	I'll continue to stick this out for awhile, maybe ride this wave back up.
47	I'm working on a new pipeline project to serve Phoenix growth.
47	Maybe the new owners will take a greater interest in assets than the previous ones.
48	We will likely not have a problem until after the merger closes next year.
48	I think for this year we'll be fine.
49	I'm working on a replacement.
50	I saw Scott last year at a Rockets game.
50	Remember Steve Dickerson, he's working with us now on a consulting basis.
51	I've called Julie twice, still waiting on a response.
52	Measurement Stds
53	Hi Beth, According to the engineers, minimum pipeline delivery pressure would likely be 750 psi at the Panda interconnect.
53	Let me know if you have questions.
53	talk with you soon.
54	Please join us in EB1339 (Goodpasture's old office) for an update on projected Western pipe capacity on Thurs.
54	11/15 from 1:30 - 2:30 pm.
54	thanks
55	FYI, Susan & Audrey
56	We'll meet at 3pm in EB1336

57	I think I saw him last night with his son at Austin's basketball practice.
58	I will be out Tuesday and Wednesday (Brandon's surgery).
58	thx
59	website is Benelliusa.com Recent pricing on two models is: Benelli Sport (removable vent ribs) for serious competitive shooters is $1145.
59	This model is very similar to the Montefeltro.
59	Montefeltro (I shoot this one) with wood stock, 12 gauge, 26" or 28" bbl is $845.
59	You can also get the M1 (same as Montefeltro but with black syn stock) for same price.
59	Both shoot 2.75 and 3 inch shells.
59	Both come with 5 choke tubes.
59	Let me know if you have further questions.
59	Kevin Hyatt
60	I'll look at other sizes / kids in her grade and call you back.
61	No meeting today but here's the update.
61	We had our meeting with AZ Public Service on Friday 11/16.
61	Here's the highlights: 30 year term is not a deal killer Rates & fuel are high but San Juan gas price helps They like the pressure guarantee They like being able to swing the volume within the day APS has electric line ROW that may include underground ROW going south towards El Paso.
61	If so, we may be able to use this path to reach Panda and the El Paso system at a reduced cost.
61	APS will check it out and get back with me.
61	Next steps: meetings are being set up with Duke, Sempra, and PG&E for the week after Thanksgiving.
61	El Paso / FERC full requirments debate: A straw man settlement proposal was floated at FERC by one of the FR shippers.
61	FERC still wants the parties to negotiate a settlement but so far there has been little progress.
62	we will have the adoption table set up Tues thru Fri this week on the 2nd floor from 11:00 to 1 in Enron Center North.
62	Please stop by.
62	thanks
63	go ahead with your plans.
63	The adoption table will be available on the 2nd floor of ECN on Tues - Fri this week 11:00 - 1
64	thanks BOB!!

69	Spoke with Jim Adams at Panda this p.m.
69	His new guy Steve Curley is now on board working transportation for Panda.
69	Jim and Steve will likely call us Tues pm or Wed with a short list of questions on the project.
69	Jim is also waiting on feedback from TECO on our proposal.
70	good analysis-- maybe you should consider a new career as an ESPN sports commentator.
70	Who knows, it might pay pretty good.
70	thanks
71	i am still interested but the level of interest will depend on cost.
72	Price would be $1150 + tax, he has one in stock.
72	Ship time is usually 3-5 days.
73	Russ-- Attached for your review is the confidential proposed Term Sheet for Transwestern's Sun Devil Project.
73	As we discussed, it includes a 20% swing capability for Duke within a 24 hour period plus delivery capability to Cal Border.
73	After you've had a chance to review, please call me and we can address any questions you may have.
73	I look forward to hearing from you later this week.

104	My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.
105	I am writing to you as Co-chair of the 2001 Enron Kids program.
105	A lot of ex-Enron folks who use your website were involved in this year's Gordon Elementary School adoption program.
105	Many of these people sacrificed some of their own Christmas so that kids at Gordon Elementary would not be let down.
105	I would like them to know that their efforts were truly appreciated by the students, faculty, and especially those of us on the Committee.
105	Would you please consider posting on your site the attached thank-you letter from the school?
105	thank you Kevin Hyatt Enron Kids Committee 2001

110	I'm looking for storage for my 2000 Expedition to hold hunting equipment.
110	What configurations do you have?
110	Also, would you be willing to sell the plans (copyrighted of course).
110	I have a pretty extensive wood shop and might want to make the box myself.
110	thanks Kevin Hyatt
111	Tony, call Rebekah at the number below.
112	Doug-- We are working up a proposal for APS in Phoenix wherein they would share in a portion of the costs we incur to get the project's FERC application ready.
112	Tab 5 of the original cost book shows a cost of $8,750,301.
112	Is this still a good number to use for our APS proposal?
112	Let's talk Wed 1/23 if possible.
112	thanks
113	Aquila informed us they are about to announce an open season in the next day or so with their partner Southwest Gas on a new storage project near Vegas.
113	They propose to have 12 Bcf total, 6 B in first phase.
113	Location is in the same salt formation as Desert Crossing.
113	They do not have a pipeline attached and look to be hooked into TW and El Paso's north system.
113	I am supposed to talk with their development person on thurs about a pipe option.
114	is this form on-line?
114	If so, how do I get to it.
114	It doesn't appear under "forms" on HRweb.
114	thanks Kevin Hyatt
115	thanks Jean!!!
116	Kevin, attached is the Sun Devil powerpoint presentation we gave to Stan back in December.
116	I added one slide since called Project Rationale.
116	The document probably has more detail than you need but more is better right?
116	Let me know if you need help cutting it down.
117	Can you tell me where to find the FASB 92 and 71 descriptions?
117	thanks
118	radio reports say he had a gunshot wound to the head and left a note.
119	The Sun Devil model is pretty big, over 2000kb, I'm not sure how well it will email but we can try it.
119	We may want to send a backup on a 100mb zip drive disk.
119	Do they have the ability to read the zip disk?
120	Attached is a summary model for TW's Sun Devil project.
120	The original model is very large; this summary version is smaller but doesn't have the links and supporting pages.
120	Please feel free to call me with any quesions.
120	Kevin Hyatt Director, Business Development

122	Call me with questions.
122	Kevin Hyatt
123	anytime except Tues morning is available for you.
123	Just let me know when and where.
124	why is it that ugly people are always the first ones to take their clothes off?
125	I spoke with Jim Adams at Panda this a.m. If it's OK with you, I'll email him a revised term sheet (subject to all the management approvals of course).
125	Let me know please if you'd prefer I not send it.
125	I won't send anything till I hear from you.
126	Jim, here is the info per our phone conversation earlier today.
126	Call me with any question you may have.
126	Regards, Kevin Hyatt
127	Due to conflict with Stan Horton's meeting this afternoon (2/5).
127	We will reconvene at the regular time on 2/12.
128	I invited Mark Brand to join us.
128	I am trying to arm twist him into staying with Enron and work with me on this pipe project.
128	Let's talk Fri a.m. on where we want to go.
129	Attached is the Sun Devil model using the $911mm Capex and project life of 30 years.
129	The model is somewhat complex and may require spending some time on the phone with James Centilli, the model's designer.
129	We will make ourselves available at your convenience.
129	Regards, Kevin Hyatt
130	I sent the model that matches up with the information we have already submitted to them.
131	I called my friend at HPD, he is out of town for a few days while his dad has surgery.
131	I also left another message for a friend I went to grad school with for him to recommend someone.
131	I'll call you later with a name or two.
131	Kevin
132	Alan, here's the open season announcement I sent to Mark Cook.
132	The scope continues to move around as shippers request various things, but call me and we can discuss it if you have any questions.
132	Kevin Hyatt
133	Eric, we may want to take a look at this report as sun devil moves further along.
134	what other time either Tues pm or Wed am are you available and I'll check.
135	I've been good so far.
135	I hear you may be meeting with Aquila this week on the Red Lake storage project.
135	Give me a shout and please let me know how that goes.
135	enjoy the joke!!!
136	I looked over the entire list.
136	It amazes me what some people got, including those in my group.
137	depending on how things shake out with sun devil this week, I'd like to tentatively plan on taking this Friday 2/15 off.
137	Let me know if there's a problem.
137	thanks
138	I just spoke with Curt Brechtel from APS this morning.
138	I had called him last week asking for feedback related to our latest Sun Devil offer to them.
138	He reviewed our offer with Tom Carlson.
138	Tom has 2 issues (listed by priority): 1) Enron credit rating and where the pipelines stand with the current financial situation.
138	Do we have a timeline wherein the pipes (specifically TW) will have its own credit rating?
138	2) Full requirements contract settlement at FERC APS still has no idea where this process will lead as far as their volume requirements are concerned.
138	APS is still comfortable committing 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sun Devil, but likely not the 200,000 we asked for (though 100,000 with an option to increase is a possibility).
139	If I can set it up, are you available for breakfast with Panda on Wed morning?
139	How early?
139	regards,
140	Panda has already scheduled other meetings around ours so they can't move our time.
140	The will likely be in our office around 1:30pm Tues and we should be done around 3:30 -4pm if you finish with Stan early and would like to join us.
140	thanks
141	David, glad to hear you're hanging in there.
141	I sent your resume over to Gaye Lyn Schaffart at Northern Border.
141	They were looking for an analyst.
141	Did anyone contact you?
141	It's been tough with Sun Devil.
141	We've changed the scope somewhat and lowered the overall cost, but the current financial situation still makes it tough.
141	stay in touch and I'll keep my eyes and ears open for you.
141	Kevin
142	It just keeps getting uglier and uglier around here.
142	How are you?
142	You making any money off getting former Enron folks hired out or are they being treated like lepers?
142	I've got a resume I'd like to send you if you're interested on a kid who was our business development analyst.
142	He came from EES and has a good risk management and modeling background.
142	Let me know if you'd like to see it.
142	Hope you and Daphne are doing well.
142	take care, Kevin Hyatt
143	EB 1336
144	a recruiter friend of mine suggested you contact leadersonline.com if you haven't already.
145	I had a conversation this morning with my contact at APS re: the Sun Devil Project.
145	Their #1 concern right now on the project is Enron creditworthiness as it regards building this pipeline.
145	How do I get them comfortable?
145	Is there a timeline for getting a credit agency rating on TW?
145	If so, when?
145	Should we get Rod Hayslett / Stan on the phone with their finance people?
145	Please advise asap so I can put an action plan together.
145	Thanks for the help.
146	Paul, here's the open season on our Sun Devil project designed to meet the growing needs of the Phoenix electric generation market.
146	Please feel free to call me with any questions.
146	thanks, Kevin Hyatt Director, Pipeline Business Development
147	OK!!!!!
147	thanks
148	Kevin, please review the attached and add any details you feel are necessary.
148	I'd like to send this to Arizona Public Service on Tuesday 2/12.
148	thanks,
149	thanks, that looks great!
150	Dear Curt-- thanks for your phone call this morning.
150	In light of our conversation, I have prepared the attached document, with help from our VP of Finance Kevin Howard, in order to help APS better understand the current and projected Transwestern credit situation.
150	After you and Tom Carlson have had a chance to review, please feel free to contact us with any questions.
151	Geneva, see the document below for the music system bid.
151	Call me and let's discuss.
152	it likely won't survive as Enron (due to the stigma), they'll rename it something that better fits a pipeline business restructured as some kind of master limited partnership.
152	Things are OK, some days are worse than others.
152	I'm still trying to develop new gas pipeline business in the west, but it's hard without a lot of loose cash lying around.
153	contact Nova Guides in Minturn, Colo have fun!!!!!!!!!!
154	I verified the numbers with Ron, he did make the addition error.
154	I also added the line for the Red Hawk lateral as a separate item.
154	James had already run the economics using $843mm plus a 5% risk adjustment adder for the Capex for a total of $885mm.
154	I think we have enough pad in this thing to take care of the error.
155	life is good, work sucks.
155	Things are a little tough, we judge the day by how many news trucks are parked outside.
155	We need a good natural disaster somewhere in the world to take the media heat off Enron.
155	Supposedly, the lead singer from Twisted Sister was in front of the building doing some kind of rap video.
155	Oh the depths we sunk to.....
156	is 2pm OK?
157	When you get the pages filled in for "supply", "Plants", and "pipeline", let's review to see how we want the summary to look.
158	Hope you're enjoying the parent visit!
158	Thanks for the VD card, that was cute.
158	If Jesse Jackson shows up here one more time, we're getting a group together and going downstairs to moon him.
159	602-250-2799, I don't have an email for him.
160	TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.
160	The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.
160	The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.
160	Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.
160	Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.
160	Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.
160	Current book value on the line is ______________ .
160	TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if: 1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or; 2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.
160	Items to Verify: 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking) Opportunities for TW: By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.
160	This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.
160	A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.
161	Per our conversation today, when you folks get a chance, I need someone to verify the current pressure of the Gomez lateral and do a linepack calculation for me.
161	We are evaluating a potential sale of the lateral and need to know how much sweet gas is in the system.
161	Please let me know if an answer by Friday 2/22 is not possible.
161	thanks for the help Kevin Hyatt Director, Asset Development
162	how many fingers am I holding up??
162	Glad to hear it went well.
162	Have a nice long weekend!!!!!!!!!1
163	Dennis-- Can you tell me, of the following POI's, which are active on any TW shipper contracts and who the shipper is, including contract number?
163	Can I get this info by sometime Tuesday 2/19?
163	thanks, KH POI
164	I'm checking that out now.
164	Western Gas, Sid Richardson, and Duke have all looked at it before.
165	When: Thursday, February 21, 2002 11:30 AM-12:30 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
166	Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project.
166	The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions.
166	Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin.
166	Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004.
166	Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market.
166	Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California.
166	Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation.
166	It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom.
166	Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States.
166	The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN.
166	For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com .
166	Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion.
166	KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals.
166	Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas.
166	Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals.
166	KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects.
167	I found these numbers in a file, Loc Code 14039, 14225, 24008 I'm not sure what assets they are in reference to.
168	Guys, is there a way you can tell me what the MMBtu content of the gas is coming into TW from NorthWest Pipeline, TransColorado, and then what it is at Gallup?
168	I'm looking for historical info for say the last 6 months.
168	thanks
169	the network may be in here shortly to interview me (Claire Shipman?) Did the parents make it out of town OK?
170	Here's the info for Gaye Lynn Schaffart (woman) she is Northern Border's Director of Business Planning & Analysis in Omaha
171	we will cancel these weekly meetings until we get some marketing contracts signed.
171	Any updates will be taken care of via weekly reports or in Steve Harris' weekly staff meeting.
171	By now you've probably heard that Kinder-Morgan shelved their Sonoran project.
171	Susan, please cancel any conf room reservation.
171	let me know if you have questions.
172	James, can you please run 2 cases to calculate a backhaul rate to Phoenix using Sun Devil?
172	case 1: Using the Capex of $290,181,156 (which includes the Red Hawk lateral), what does the rate need to be using 100% load factors for 20 years with the terminal value and our hurdle return rate of 15%?
172	Assume fuel at 0% for the entire term (source of gas would likely be Cal border area storage facilities).
172	case 2: same as above but load factors as follows: We are trying to respond to Panda Energy by Friday 2/22.
172	thanks
173	yes the 750 case, sorry I left that out.
174	good job, thanks
175	I didn't see myself this a.m., maybe on the evening portion at 5:30pm
176	the new cable modem at home is great (I got the first month free).
176	It's like being at work in terms of internet speed.
176	Now I can download those Victoria Secret catalogs even faster!!!!!!!!!!
177	I have a meeting with the customer Thursday morning, is it possible to have an answer by this afternoon??
178	did you have any luck locating that power plant file I gave you?
179	yep, it's as fast as what I have at work.
180	go for it.
180	Maybe some public exposure will get you some job offers.
181	snap out of it!!!!!!!!!!
181	(easy for me to say right).
181	Don't dwell on the past.
181	Have you been putting your resume on internet job boards?
181	An outfit called me yesterday wanting my resume.
181	Contact jessiica@searchconsultants.com
182	try these AM 610, 950, maybe 740
183	looks good, thanks for the help!
184	yours truly just got interviewed by the Office of the US Trustee to see if I wanted to serve on the Creditors Committee representing the ex- and current employee group.
184	I find out later if I made the cut.
185	Bill, I need a confidentiality agrmt for a proposed pipe sale transaction.
185	We are evaluating possibly selling a lateral piece of TW pipe to Pioneer.
185	They are interested in purchasing approx.
185	35 miles of pipe that TW took out of service in 2000.
185	The pipe in located in Ward and Pecos County, Texas.
185	Once the C.A.
185	is executed, we would let Pioneer begin due diligence covering information such as easements, maintenance records, physical location, etc. Pioneer is an owner/operator of gas gathering & intrastate pipe transmission assets.
185	Their info is as follows: Pioneer Gas Pipeline, Inc. Mr. Philip R. Allard, President San Angelo, Texas 76903 fax 915-655-3315 let me know if you need any further info.
185	Kevin Hyatt
186	I saw this too.
186	Is this just more stumping by "concerned" politicians in a congressional election year ( I can't remember what party Brady is with).
186	Is it going to be a meaningful meeting or just an "open mic" bitch session.
186	I'd pass and read the results in the paper (media is invited) or the web site.
187	Jean, I'm trying to rebuild my PC at home.
187	The hard drive cratered on me.
187	I've installed a new one, but the only windows operating system I have is on a restore disk from Compaq (win95) and for some reason, it's giving me an "image builder" error when I try the restore.
187	This may be due to the fact that I trying to restore on a bigger hard drive than the original.
187	Anyway, I also have win98 upgrade 2nd edition.
187	When I try to load this, is looks for verification of ownership of a previous win system (which I don't have except on the restore disk which won't work).
187	So my question is this, do we have an old Win98 operating system lying around I can borrow so I can load my win98 upgrade?
187	thanks, Kevin

189	did you see this?
190	depending on cost for 1 vs. 2 subscriptions, yes
191	selling out other criminals to bring a speedy resolution to this thing is right
192	FERC has scheduled a conference call for Wed 2/27 to discuss this topic.
192	I am checking with Glen Hass in Omaha to see if we can get tied into the call.
193	hey I got the printer (thank you).

197	I'll let you know timing when I get it.
197	If you think of anything else you'd like to review, please let me know.
197	best regards, talk with you soon.
198	I have a conflict on Friday, what about another day next week?
199	I would say 1 and if necessary, we could share it.
200	that will work.
200	Let's talk Monday morning and confirm that we're still on.
201	if it's OK with you, I'll invite Susan Wadle.
202	Economics: Pioneer has offered $2mm for pipe that has a current book value of $533,000.
202	Replacement value of the pipe is roughly $26.8mm.
202	Potential Buyers: Sid Richardson has previously expressed an interest in the lateral.
202	Other area gathering companies include Duke, El Paso, and Western Gas Resources.
202	I've contacted Kim Watson about getting Richardson engaged.
202	I'll use the TW marketing Team to make contacts at the other companies.
202	Pioneer has executed the confidentiality agreement.
202	I'm in the process of assembling easement and maintenance records.
202	If you'd like to get together this week and go through a process analysis for this transaction, let me know when would be a good time.
203	got it
204	only 2,687 mcf, this is per the field guys last week when they did the pressure check.
205	Roger, see note below.
205	Can you please have someone start pulling the ROW files for this pipe?
205	Once they're available, I'd like to review them before we open them up to Pioneer.
205	thanks for the help.
206	thanks Bob!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
207	I am still slated to be the panel chairperson for the Natural Gas Infrastructure Committee at the Electric Power Conference in St. Louis March 19-21, 2002.
207	As chairperson, my conference registration is free ($525 value), I only have to pay air/hotel/meals.
207	Is it still OK to attend this conference?
208	I will be there.
208	thanks, Kevin Hyatt Enron Transportation Services
209	Susan, talk with me on Thurs on this.
210	When: Thursday, February 28, 2002 3:30 PM-4:30 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
210	Where: Hyatt's ofc
211	i agree, let's keep the BaseDat too.
212	yes please
213	Paul, thanks for your email.
213	We are working hard to get the Sun Devil project ready for FERC filing, likely by Sept 2002.
213	If you would like to send a qualification package, please remit to my project engineer at: Enron Transportation Services Mr. Arnold Eisenstein PO Box 1188 best regards, Kevin Hyatt
214	SD 750 case
215	we are still on target to file the FERC app in September.
215	Are you planning to attend the Aquila Storage meeting this morning?
216	pls forward eticket for Kevin Hyatt to ECN 1334.
217	yeah I saw this.
217	Wonder where they plan on getting the fuel supply????????|
218	Attached are my notes from the open season meeting today.
218	Feel free to amend with your own notes (those of you who attended of course).
218	Call me with any questions.
219	great, I will touch base Tues.
220	You guys have probably already noodled on this, but if you haven't, maybe it's worth organizing a meeting next week to discuss the above storage project and benefits / risks to TW.
220	For instance: Risks: Red Lake connection to Kern cuts into TW forward haul market Rewards: expands TW's Park n' Ride capabilities (we offer more capability and back it with a storage position) better PnR rates over the short term than what the storage can offer more backhaul business on TW mainline (i.e. Citizens Utilities) Compression ops agrmt w/ Aquila Let me know if you'd like to get together for a brainstorm session.
220	Bids are due to Aquila by 3/15 and there are some financial caveats to discuss.
221	you inner loop people lead such the lifestyle.
221	I'll take a rain check and plan on taking you to lunch later this week.
221	Let me know what day is good-- and we're taking your new truck!!!!
222	Jeff-- per our conversation this morning, attached is the original project open season announcement from August 2001.
222	A couple of current changes are: Volume to Phoenix market - 750,000 MMBtu/d Volume to Cal Border - 30,000 San Juan receipts - 780,000 Projected rate to Phoenix - $0.45/MMBtu We are also offering 16 hour peaking capability (max daily quantity available in 16 hours, not 24) and pressure guarantees to those FT customers directly connected to the system (which doesn't help Bowie but may help you somewhere else).
222	Please don't hesitate to call me with any questions.
222	Best Regards, Kevin Hyatt Director, Asset Development
223	Hi Jim- I hope your conversation with Paul Cherry went well last week.
223	Paul indicated to me that you might be sending a Conf Agrmt for us to execute so you could then pass along to us some of the debt covenant waterfall language.
223	I'll be happy to push that agreement thru the channels here once you send it.
223	If you feel it might be faster for us to send you our standard form agreement, let me know.
223	Also, along those same confidential lines, if you can provide to me some various operating scenarios for the plant (high, low, and base case operating assumptions) I can begin designing an SFV rate for you to look at.
223	Let me know please.
223	thanks Kevin Hyatt
224	When: Tuesday, March 05, 2002 9:00 AM-10:00 AM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
225	my dentist has scheduled a root canal for me this Thursday at 2:30 pm.
225	Let me know if I should need to re-schedule.
225	thx
226	will do, thanks
227	Max, here's a copy of the email I sent to Jeff.
228	Eric, here's an abbreviated rate model James put together for us.
229	Cancel me for the pm session on 3/7 as I now have another conflict.
229	thanks Kevin Hyatt
230	Subject: Why did the chicken cross the road?
230	A new updated version.....
230	KINDERGARTEN TEACHER: To get to the other side.
230	PLATO: For the greater good.
230	ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross roads.
230	KARL MARX: It was a historical inevitability.
230	CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK: To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.
230	DR.
230	TIMOTHY LEARY: Because that's the only trip the establishment would let it take.
230	SADDAM HUSSEIN: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion.
230	We were justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.
230	RONALD REAGAN: I forgot.
230	HIPPOCRATES: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.
230	ANDERSEN CONSULTING: Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was a threatening dominant market position.
230	The chicken was faced with significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the newly competitive market.
230	Andersen Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and implementation processes.
230	Using the Poultry Integration Model(PIM), Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge, capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework.
230	Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in the transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementing an enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry cross-median processes.
230	The meeting was held in a park-like setting, enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear and unified market message and aligned with the chicken's mission,vision, and core values.
230	This was conducive towards the creation of a total business integration solution.
230	In summary, Andersen Consulting helped the chicken manage change to become more successful.
230	LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you see, represents the black man.
230	The chicken crossed the black man in order to trample him and keep him down.
230	DR.
230	MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.
230	MOSES: And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the chicken, "Thou shalt cross the road."
230	And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.
230	FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own Eyes.
230	How many more chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?
230	RICHARD NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road.
230	I repeat, the chicken did NOT cross the road.
230	MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road.
230	Who cares why?
230	The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.
230	JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road?
230	I mean, why doesn't anyone ever think to ask, "What the heck was this chicken doing walking around all over the place, anyway?"
230	SIGMUND FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.
230	BILL GATES: I will soon release the new Chicken Office 2002, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook.
230	OLIVER STONE: The question is not, "Why did the chicken cross the road? "Rather, it is, "Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?"
230	CHARLES DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally selected and evolved over time in such a way that they are now genetically endowed with the capabilities required to cross roads.
230	ALBERT EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.
230	BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.
230	RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road.
230	It transcended it.
230	COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one.
230	BILL CLINTON : I did not, repeat, did not have sexual relations with the chicken.
231	sorry, I was thinking bi-directional and wrote unilateral.
231	The CA with Panda should be bi-lateral.
232	outstanding, thanks!!!
233	Here's the info for Ms. Gaye Lynn Schaffart she is Northern Border's Director of Business Planning & Analysis in Omaha
234	Dear Phil, Hope you received the easement and line maps OK.
234	We are pulling the maintenance records together and should have this done by 3/15.
234	How does your calendar look for Friday 3/22 to meet at the Monahans office or early the week of 3/25.
234	Prior to 3/22 I will be out of the office at a power convention in St. Louis, returning Thursday 3/21.
234	I could then meet you at Monahans on 3/22 or sometime the following week.
234	let me know.
234	Best Regards, Kevin Hyatt
235	Following up on our conversation re: Red Lake storage assuming only a Phoenix lateral gets built off TW, no mainline or SJ expansion: Capital cost is estimated at $304mm.
235	A fully subscribed rate on volume of 750,000/d to get a 15% ROR would be $.152/MMBtu (with zero fuel retention).
235	If we assume a more gradual volume ramping up, beginning with 50% load factor in year 1 climbing to 100% in year 8, the target transport rate would need to be $.248 (closer to my "top of the head" $.30 we discussed yesterday).
235	Both of these scenarios assume 80/20 Debt/equity and a salvage value in year 20 of the project equal to 1/3 of the capital cost.
235	Also, regarding the Kern River expansion, what might the likelihood be of Mojave receiving Kern gas and backhauling to TW for delivery into Aquila Red Lake?
235	If the Kern volume of 700,000 (out of 900,000 capacity) doesn't go to Calif end-users, I think Mojave will have a somewhat stranded segment from Cal border to the Kern interconnect.
235	We could then take this gas and haul it to Phoenix.
235	Let me know what you think
236	and where are you going?
237	if heat exhaust is counted in the "renewable" category, this would be another opportunity to take waste heat at TW compressor stations and convert it to electricity at above market rates.
237	We are looking at one of these opportunties at TW station 1.
238	I'll check and let you know
239	Good luck, is it the same outfit we've been working with who handles Red Cedar's production into TW?
240	see what happens when you leave the gas bidness homey?
240	Williams was in some pretty dire financial straights ala Enron and debt they had with their communications group.
240	They apparently realized this last fall and started to panic.
240	Buffet boys come in and pick off one of the crown jewels at a pretty sweet price (including the KRGT expansion).
240	The sale not only helps WPL's current finances but eliminates the need to spend $1.2bn on the expansion.
240	What's interesting is the preferred shares also established in the deal.
240	Warren could end up owning a big chunk of WPL when it's over.
241	Arnold-- what's the word on ORMAT & Sta 1 heat recovery?
241	Are they pursuing?
241	We may have additional opportunities for ORMAT based on pending legislation in New Mexico.
241	let me know please
242	When: Thursday, March 14, 2002 10:30 AM-11:30 AM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
242	Where: EB1334
243	The question below was forwarded to me by Aquila.
243	The question (in red) is from PPL.
243	What would be TW's strategy and can someone get back with PPL?
243	thanks
244	I'm not sure how current this number is but try Brad at 412-359-2306

262	Last week FERC staff recommended to the full commission that the FR contracts be converted to CD contracts, in effect abrogating a huge chunk of the original 1996 El Paso settlement.
262	The indicated shippers last year did file a Section 5 complaint against El Paso, accusing the pipeline of over selling its capacity.
262	This debate has been one of the biggest hindrances in getting shippers to commit to the Sun Devil project.
263	It was nice meeting you too!
263	Please feel free to email or call anytime with questions or concerns regarding Austin.
